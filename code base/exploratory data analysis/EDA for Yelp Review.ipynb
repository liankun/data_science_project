anywhere else always add/remove whatever want dessert. think also great offer sugar levels (like me) enjoy things sweet. initially wanted try new item menu seemed waffle taco ice cream; however, due covid ordering process mostly contactless, could order tablet really appear menu ordered. <br><br>i ended change order taro milk-shaved ice would say okay. thought really cool included real taro pieces munch on. however, feel many ingredients compensate amount shaved ice, left shaved ice end. course, taken go, hard put ingredients to-go packages, place may still worth second try experiencing indoors rather to-go.this place tastes great, always worth wait. covid order ahead, wait actually bad though.<br><br>in summer, love icy signature dishes herbal jelly taro balls. otherwise go-to grass jelly milk tea. first place tried grass jelly boba topping, since able find anywhere else well. <br><br>their signature dishes pretty big would recommend sharing someone else.<br>overall, great

impossible check everything mixed one bowl.love grass jelly (hot/cold) taro qq. i\\'m always torn category get whenever go there, i\\'ve leaning towards icy grass jelly days. grass jelly ice melts slower togo. also gotta give shout boba - love smaller slide (not mini boba, like pearl) perfect consistency/texture. <br><br>my favorites: icy taro ball #1 icy grass jelly #1. <br>their signature icy grass jelly good too, prefer lots add-ons. double taro signature two balls top thought ice cream, taro paste. know, might sound kinda \"eek\", actually surprisingly good. <br><br>i\\'d suggest adjust ice/sugar level...why adjust ice level trying order \"icy\" dessert? options desserts without ice here. also, tried 2/3 sweetness barely sweet icy taro ball, also thought regular sweetness sweet ._. wish would give us sugar water side us adjust home, especially since melts ice faster. i\\'m missing pre-covid period dine want shaved ice. pretty sure togo container gives us smaller portion - &nbsp;the shaved ice dine-in usually enough feed 4 people. friend\\'s face saw shaved ice ordered hilarious. apparently picture menu looked like portion would \"tiny\". <br><br>their drinks also surprisingly good, see people would opt come order drinks desserts now. herbal jelly tea refreshing.<br><br>i find current reward system app annoying though. i\\'ve successfully gotten points order (out least 7 orders). never tried ordering directly app, i\\'ve always ordered kiosk in-store. btw, changed kiosk entering phone number instead holding buzzer order.yesterday ordered hot grass jelly soup go enjoyed much. today came back dine in. however, sorry say disappointed. waited 45 mins two dessert. red bean soup hot all. taro paste volcano shaved ice &nbsp;was totally disappointed. use plate. instead, use bowl ( like red bean soup) put ingredient including pudding , boba, red bean bottom big chunk ice ( even shaved) top. whole presentation bad, totally different picture. also, people came got order faster me. food drink put counter top, customers keep checking touching food check order number customer service help. everyone frustrated. <br>i hope improvement.i often come

comfortable indoor seating major plus days.i think desserts carry meet fresh okay flavors pretty basic. family enjoyed bc like basic desserts minimal flavors. i\\'m upset price pay give coconut milk, dairy creamers put desserts? that\\'s blasphemous going asian place using milk/creamer, instead coconut milk. maybe i\\'m use coconut milk vietnamese, thai, cambodian desserts. mean i\\'m paying $6-7 dessert expect coconut milk. plus, i\\'m lactose many asians are! <br><br>however, price pricey asian desserts. would skip this, like basic desserts dairy creamer, half half maybe try out. looking really great desserts fresh ingredients coconut milk skip place.after ordered picked desserts, drove 20 minutes home find double taro signature dessert came taro paste ice cream. extremely upset expect pay $10 bowl shaved ice jelly..... taro paste ice cream especially highlight dessert. sure make 20 minute drive again.i would like give zero star choice. came morning, 3 customers, told can\\'t order counter, order machines; machines user friendly all, items machine menu one told asked, finally make order machine, waiting 15 minutes server came told toppings still cooking. anyway, place worst service imagine.this ridiculous. always go hot grass jelly option b order uber eats. however, never never comes taro, instead, always gives signature one. really hard crew check things packing up? also, provide taro option, confusing list description option b. disappointing see happen again. besides, never successfully make call local store always transferred autoreply.ordered online cancelled order. got store ordered got text order ready. even prepared yet. checked order times kept saying 20minutes. ab hour, requested refund. &nbsp;bad experiencei yet find another shaved ice/bingsoo place near that\\'s good meet fresh. different shaved ice i\\'ve tried menu really like mochi one. taro mochi brown/white mochi favorite. syrup flavoring top really familiar flavor can\\'t quite name sweet. summer approaches i\\'ll definitely come back again. portions larger shaved ice bowls pretty big split amongst 4 people (at minimum). <br><br>the line usually pretty long weekends weekdays okay coming without wait.i go place time whenever i\\'m cupertino. usually get fresh milk tea brown/black sugar dripping sides cup. tastes delicious really taste milk. reason put 4 stars milk syrup ratio even. whenever mix drink, usually taste milk instead actual syrup. overall, tastes delicious.on sunday brunch friends went get taiwanese shaved ice. space huge include seating area shares another drink/juice place. high ceiling nice chairs, table booths. desserts, drinks excellent. big problem process. got early, ordered received order fairly quickly. however, time friends us eating conversing, line backed door. patrons ordered sat pagers many went back complain long taking get shaved ice. <br><br>the management really addressed actual process production product. one cashier, inefficient dessert maker poor production table flow. happen sit could watch dessert making process behind counter. meet fresh could much better efficient enhance customer experience.first came roughly 3+ years ago (sept 2016) meetfresh soft opening. original thought 3+ years ago \"traditional taiwanese flavor\" even even close right flavor. experience 3 years ago bad begin with. think one many reasons place popular due lack competition otherwise long line....<br><br>after 3+ years, friends asked want grab dessert meetfresh hesitated bit. decided give meetfresh another chance see they\\'ve improved since soft-opening 3+ years ago. last time ordered traditional milk tea tasted like sugar water milk. time, ordered purple rick soup red beans, rice balls, peanuts (replaced barley). problem charge extra $0.50 cents change could barely locate barley purple rice soup (not sure soup rather porridge.... zhou soup porridge...). purple rice zhou extremely watery lots red beans rice ball barley. entire dish basically red bean soup purple rice.<br><br>my friend also ordered egg waffle well. waffle overly dried, flavorless, cold. asked employee it, basically stated waffle served cold crispy texture. frank statement, waffle need served cold crisp texture. also, excuse overly dried flavorless waffle...<br><br>end day sure even bother come back try unauthentic traditional taiwanese desert... flavor palate still (basically covering flavor sugar - aka, way saying \"traditional taiwanese flavor\"). honest it, traditional market taiwan makes better dessert meetfresh.there\\'s always long line place goes pretty damn slow. probably would line door would one person register. <br><br>anyways, always get meet fresh signature (cold). comes grass jelly flavored shaved ice, grass jelly taro sweet potato balls. seriously though, first ordered this, thought shaved ice actually brown sugar first dug it. thank god shaved ice. tastes exactly like hong van\\'s grass jelly drink &nbsp;that sell asian stores, turned shaved ice. pretty decent &nbsp;it super refreshing especially hot summer days. <br><br>overall, place okay, stand line wait 15 minutes this. careful go. go weekends week nights, probably packed. first time came saturday night, waited line 5 minutes realized wait long rate moving left. went back month ago weekday, 3, busy. actually wait all. came back couple days ago, around 2 pm wait 15 minutes so.zero star. understand covid-19 thing challenge 6 months. expect better workflow.<br><br>they say \"do enter without pickup text!\". guess obedient wait 45 minutes outside sun.<br><br>went inside make sure nothing goes wrong, go wong. person gave order without saying anything, bloody ice melted.<br><br>if cannot handle 7 order systems time, disable one two weekend. experience awful.never respond pick order! wait half hour. came store said machine turn on. total waste time! still get refund!definitely hyped place get desserts/drinks! &nbsp;meet fresh refreshing, sweet tasty!<br><br>drink:<br>i\\'ve tried brown sugar fresh milk boba drink probably one best brown sugars boba i\\'ve ever tasted! actually taste fresh milk bobas hard chewy, they\\'re perfect! brown sugar also right level sweetness!! definitely recommend drink! <br><br>food:<br>i\\'ve tried icy taro ball #2, majority contents bowl tasted fresh delicious fruits okay. nothing special option. sesame mochi ball, pretty good believe $1 1! <br><br>*the signature ice grass jelly popular item here, hope try one day!! <br><br>service:<br>they give buzzer order pick tray/drinks counter. service quite slow sometimes large amount people come here! drinks worth wait! <br><br>location:<br>many seats inside spots outside take order to-go probably find nice quiet bench sit at! sometimes tables dirty since workers pretty busy loads customer.<br><br>*parking struggle want park super close mind walking bit, two main parking structures nearby park!favorite spot grass jelly! blackball can\\'t even hold candle meet fresh! looking authentic taiwanese types desserts, look further.<br><br>this location fairly large shared spaced chansii tea, plenty seating either bar, tables booths. vast menu shaved ice hot desserts well drinks many toppings.<br><br>my go-to definitely signature grass jelly (ice) finely shaved ice, silky grass jelly sweet potato/taro balls. get one cup creamer pour top. refreshing, herbal overly sweet- hint sweetness. ice great texture soaks excess liquid grass jelly. grass jelly herbal flavor, soft agar agar \"crunch\" smooth without goopy. sweet potato taro balls favorite, they\\'re made sweet rice flour they\\'re basically sweet rice cakes. one serving enough share two people. price definitely reasonable quality, flavor portion size.<br><br>meet fresh get pretty crowded line door. choose line order register like customize orders add-ons substitutions go self-service register- last heard lack customizability system.<br><br>desserts come pretty quick placing order. lots space inside, seating outdoors wish. great place dessert, without feeling weighed guilty!<br><br>they use five stars

nice. rude? i\\'ve bad experience that. one time closing early 4pm. line then, waited like almost 30 mins cashier tell \"oh, able complete order 4pm, take order.\" world??? fault slow? <br><br>food\\'s okay here. really felt different location cupertino fremont irvine locations. general, like taro balls sweet potato balls. anything good. used almond milk tea that\\'s lightly sweetened easy drink, easy wallet. like taro ball combo #1 red bean soup base. lots chewing required, huge bowl, hence $7. shareable expected.glad went without looking reviews beforehand. ordered signature ice grass jelly dessert- wow! huge portion split 2 people. grass jelly subtle coffee flavor, mochi right texture, cream topping made everything come together. <br><br>i recommend coming need break mall. order dessert hang cool seatingword caution, bother spending money here.<br><br>you\\'ll end throwing everything asay like did.<br><br>met coworker since wanted quick place grab something drink hsve dessert. <br><br>for reason check yelp afterwards, bad, could saved money time.<br><br>mochi peanut, oolong cream drink, friend got shaved ice.<br><br>firstoff oolong tea bad tasted like

vending machine, chunky flavorful plain soggy mochi surrounding it.<br><br>omg, wish could get bitter crappy taste mouth....i think place seriously killed tastebuds!!!!i tried contact store nobody would like help me. &nbsp;i talked cashier said system problem. redeeming $10 order, end lowest price would chosen system automatically. please try fix system, otherwise need promote reward program. can\\'t redeem correct way. one star review customer service.i\\'ve never written yelp review, felt upset felt obligated tell people service received.<br><br>i ordered hot red bean soup yesterday around 8:00pm also q mochi pudding shaved ice brought home. made substitutions order, getting fresh taro subbing potaro balls ice cream melon jelly shaved ice getting q mochi rice balls instead. iced dessert tasted fine, bit sweeter side, still nice. gave mother red bean soup said boba made dessert taste weird, tried myself. tasted sour sure that\\'s since first time getting it. know want continue eating ate dessert. <br>after going back forth bit sweet shaved ice red bean soup, hot red bean soup definitely tasted like sour, spoiled. know tasted way taro balls rice balls etc found icy dessert well tasted fine, suspect boba soup, get it, happens. mother told call meet fresh dessert right, called told issue assured make red bean soup fresh morning spoiled, remake next day sour taste dessert unpleasant family consume appreciated that.<br><br>i came next day work around 8:30pm get remake dessert came told name brought receipt sure right person. told substitutions wanted happy hear finally almond pudding asked instead fresh taro rice balls instead boba (since sure reason sour taste, better safe sorry). waited order minutes manager presume (she wearing meet fresh uniform) told taro balls going take 5 minutes wanted get mini taro balls, said i\\'d fine wait it. sat store maybe 10-13 minutes still waiting hot red bean soup, waiting taro balls. okay waiting also work 2 jobs food industry understand time gave estimation exactly precise. saw started working remake, called up, employee thanked waiting said sorry wait wanted check soup sure sourness tasted day realized dessert supposed taste, looking bag dessert, made order wrong without substitutions almond pudding put fresh taro. reluctant tell it, like fresh taro told it. <br><br>this reason gave 1 star starts.<br><br>when coming saying remake incorrect, manager gave lot attitude say \"what\\'s problem\" \"i can\\'t hear you\" negative tone said tell problem employee said want fresh taro almond pudding. manager took another customer\\'s order, came back conversation blamed getting order wrong saying \"you said wanted fresh taro it\" 100% know not, even original receipt, says \"no taro.\" also make sense fresh taro would dessert asked almond pudding substitution equivalent get almond pudding replacement another topping dessert, aka, fresh taro. also tried prove said wanted fresh taro make sense me. then, bringing problem almond pudding, said \"i gave almond pudding, even asked wanted side dessert??\" said yes, did, said wanted side receive it, surprise surprise, never gave left counter side said \"it\\'s right here.\" end, kept attitude told employee make \"just make sure get whatever wants right.\"<br><br>this whole situation made experience 0 star, 1 star alright staff working nice. apologized again, knows manager treated order incorrect making order, appreciate efforts customer service.<br><br>the desserts okay, really liked mochi, service received worth coming again.service: terrible. bunch employees hanging laughing hard even care guests. let us use self service computers boy standing/sitting big groups thinking father\\'s store. <br><br>food: horrible. maybe ordered wrong item, definitely bland sandy. even want remember order. think something like red bean soup? boy impressed. <br><br>price: maybe ok? food quality... i\\'d rather spending anything though. <br><br>overall: nope.walked meet fresh try desserts. would say majority dishes halfway decent, ultimately experience underwhelming especially comes service.<br><br>meet fresh offers opportunity \"self order\" ipad order cashier. given experience staff, would highly suggest order via ipad least know getting. ordered 3 dishes - 1 entered right first time. another completely mis-entered last one, caught temperature wrong right hit submit. killed cashier even asked clarification orders (hot/cold, one, point) still got totally wrong - ridiculous.<br><br>after placing order, grabbed pager found seat. overall, ambiance actually pretty nice. area brightly lit, tables wiped down, seats pretty comfy. also get chance take wall art convenient features like clean station desserts take eternity make. took 30 minutes.<br><br>now, understand good things take time, time taken, even good. honestly, dessert house, would expect cauldrons boiling red bean soup, tofu, almond milk, grass jelly - etc toppings least par-boiled make fast. dishes take time ones would never age well (like steamed puddings, example). rather, saw meet fresh bowl get microwaved one one filled brim zero presentation. <br><br>upon picking dishes, generally disappointing around. let\\'s break down:<br><br>red bean mini taro balls rice balls - look, comped red bean soup restaurants better flavor red bean soup here....it\\'s saying something. spoonful tepid watered best. toppings also sunk bottom looked completely unappetizing upon delivery opinion<br><br>almond milk signature #1 - surprise! actually got grass jelly #1 comes mung beans, barley, boba. catch receipt unfortunately, grass jelly almond milk sound little different opinion. making best situation though, still consumed dessert found pretty good. overly sweet good balance texture. also never considered grass jelly hot worked opinion. like red bean soup, toppings also sunk prior delivery. pouring dessert to-go container made look way palatable (see pictures).<br><br>tofu soup sweet potato taro balls - pleasantly surprised given two large scoops tofu delivered generally unbroken. initially \"confused\" sweet potato balls taro balls, later corrected waitress sweet potato balls taro inside. probably best part soup. tofu, delicate impart much flavor. that\\'s also probably sugar soup base definitely way sweet enjoyable definitely needed something counter (maybe slice ginger). <br><br>all all, impressed i\\'m sure recommend coming back given experience price point despite desserts generally okay.wife obsessed finding best grass jelly dessert. <br><br>we others bay area knew expect &nbsp; taste good fan. <br>three stars cuz staff bit disorganized messy. drinks desserts worth coming.everyone critic. dessert place daly city, mall, think place decently priced, good location desserts yummy. yes, mess bit times place busy! thing would say make sesame balls favorite they\\'ve while! <br><br>don\\'t come saturday night weekend night all. come time enjoy dessert friends get better experience.still loving place! came recent friday afternoon line order longer usual probably cuz kids spring break and/or kids got school. matter still got order reasonable amount time. ordered usual hot taro ball #6 added extra taro balls. soon told ran crunchy jelly noodles substituted taro balls (my fave!) yes! also found could also substitute items. good know future get taro balls lol<br><br>a shout carol working front friendly, helpful great energy often found kind places. rock carol!i\\'m big sweets, recently discovered fan asian desserts. &nbsp;my newfound fondness drew meet fresh, food establishment specializes taiwanese desserts...which one favorite dessert joints.<br><br>at arrival, customers typically find eatery packed patrons nearly every table line place orders. &nbsp;the menu extensive array teas, soups, small bites, etc., come hot cold versions. &nbsp;they even serve shaved ice without ice cream milk. &nbsp;so many items choose from, could difficult decide something, especially first timers. &nbsp;fortunately, cashiers patient willing help anyone may feel lost, indecisive, interested customizing order. &nbsp;expect wait least ten minutes order ready. &nbsp;each table equipped charging station mobile phones, plus.<br><br>initially, mom impressed milk tea (a version taro red beans), changed mind trying jasmine milk tea, told husband enjoyed. &nbsp;i faithful hot almond soup w/tofu pudding + taro balls. &nbsp;i devour entire bowl, use willpower eat half, refrigerate rest, enjoy cold leftover next day. &nbsp;no worries, taro balls harden overnight fridge, somehow maintain delightful chewiness. &nbsp;next time (yes, definitely return), might add boba...and maybe jasmine milk tea well. &nbsp;:)when reviews, tend focus taste food rather service. asian, say fact asian places best guaranteeing great customer service, though food mostly point. <br><br>meet fresh taiwanese chain establishment based taiwan. one thing meet fresh boast self ordering option cut wait time. though problem selection self ordering menu may actually available add wait time. set buzzer pick drink, also mean staff preparing order quicker. i\\'ve used took us 30+ minutes get drink order. so, personally might well go directly talk cashier place order, especially want something customized.<br><br>onto taste, ordered purple rice drink tapioca personally pretty good. sweet, rich fulfilling. recommend rice drink someone ate lunch looking dessert, since heavy stomach. friend also tried flan grass jelly shaved ice, absolutely loved upon trying taste it. refreshing, sweet, right ratio.<br><br>for prices, definitely pricey side since getting big portion standard milk tea place. purple drink around $8, bowl well. worth price, think personally. also place that\\'s geared towards sit dessert actually come go place.<br><br>the location meet fresh within serramonte shopping center. daly city bay area parking general horrible. parking always packed especially weekends. ambiance overall atmosphere place, like it. inviting, aesthetically pleasing, clean part.<br><br>all all, great place hang friends get refreshing bowl drink. someone loves asian desserts savory, sweet options, great place try!quality dropped much. ordered three desserts, barely okay. need lots improvement.not impressed service.<br>no boba. &nbsp;30 minute wait make it. <br>cashier completely clueless.<br><br>but...<br><br>the jasmine milk tea (hot) point &amp; peanut mochi, tho tiny, yummy! <br><br>thank goodness great company &amp; tasty treats cuz might slapped b!i went saturday around 6 pm busy. &nbsp;i love busy. &nbsp;this time ordered q mochi shaved milk ice plus favorite signature icy grass jelly bowl. &nbsp;both outstanding! &nbsp;the shaved ice sweetened brown sugar, drizzled sweet condensed milk, topped scoop french vanilla ice cream. &nbsp;it came delicious variety mochi toppings: &nbsp;taro-filled sweet potato balls, mini mochi, brown sugar mochi, tapioca noodles, etc. &nbsp;absolutely delicious!!! &nbsp;the price $9.80 size ginormous, well worth price. &nbsp;enough 2.<br><br>the service time horrible like last time went there. &nbsp;the service pretty fast. &nbsp;and forget order. &nbsp;haha.<br><br>the space pretty clean. &nbsp;the tables seats clean too. <br><br>i definitely would go back. &nbsp;too bad live east bay. &nbsp;i wish open store soon dublin pleasanton area.don\\'t put photo promo items location offering product. &nbsp;this 2nd time saw

around here.the signature red bean soup extra black sesame balls added jam. childhood, even better! warm soup great, slightly thicker consistency. sweet. excellent variety squishy, soft toppings, sesame balls soooo good! <br><br>great sharing. definitely returning (every time i\\'m area probably)i\\'m fan!<br><br>while many boba/dessert spots daly city, meet fresh brings unique style asian dessert/specialty drinks convenient location.<br><br>there many reviews poor quality service location. meet fresh cupertino lines seem endless. run issue location. also never encountered memorably rude services either.<br><br>alas, reason come definitely unique offering asian style drinks desserts. really liked signature herbal tea enjoyed hot cold depending mood.<br><br>i also discovered seasonal winter menu included purple rice drink almond milk. purple rice drink comes bits purple rice, red bean, milk. almond milk creamy nutty blend almond milk. <br><br>while enjoy meet fresh, would

however, place puts much ice weak flavor like paying $12 $6 drink. tastes almost like barely sweetened skim milk, yuk!<br><br>have given couple tries even asked \"go easy ice.\" attached photo

barley small taro balls, that\\'s go-to. <br><br>no matter time come here, always wait. whether 3pm, 7pm 9pm, wait door, prepared that. one cashier helping customers line, also take togo phone orders, tends hold line, fault. struggle waiting cold fog haha<br><br>they also trust customers collect trash put cleaning area, super neat, like ikea!totally spot hangout snack. <br>super addicting. grass jelly signature w/mong bean favorite duo next favorite #4 red bean soup extra sweet potato. favorite drink jasmine green team w/boba. workers nonstop feet working like crazy cuz lines always long place packed every time go.i wish checked reviews came since expected quickly, nope!!<br><br>order: <br>oolong milk tea boba<br><br>pros: <br>a huge menu drinks asian-style desserts, including taiwanese style taro balls red bean soup, boba / pudding / jelly drinks. <br>they fresh milk teas option addition ones made creamer. <br>boba good consistency. <br>25% sweet = perfect me. bonus points options reduce sweetness ice, places days. <br>very new modern decor, clean looking. <br>a ton seating (caveat: place lot seated customers weekend). <br><br>cons: <br>the parking lot shopping center insane, general. prepare circle especially weekends. <br>if that\\'s enough, service hella slow seem understaffed, seemed like process getting things done efficient people working seemed either confused frazzled. desserts look like things take much setting (how hard put red bean soup cup?). much line got order taken, yet waited 15 minutes boba. better efficiency streamlining assembly line would help.i enjoyed meet fresh cupertino location super excited there\\'s new location daly city! although wait soft opening back october long/about 1-2 hours, still worth grass jelly desserts. seen dessert shop san francisco fresh taste. make house shops get grass jelly cans! <br><br>have nearly 15 times since opening use fivestars rewards discounts! note: label items herbal known others grass jelly. ordering, use term \"herbal\" :) <br><br>what get: <br>- herbal jelly: meet fresh icy signature (comes herbal jelly, herbal shaved ice, large taro balls, milk creamer side). hot version also

winter special only: hot almond soup comes kidney beans, boba, mini taro balls, almond flakes almond soup.<br>- hot/iced herbal tea like herbal tea taste. hot tea also become jelly cools. <br>- fluffy icy herbal tea grass jelly: heavy milky cream grass jelly shaved herbal ice. good option want full herbal jelly meet fresh signature bowl since comes everything drink plus large taro balls.i\\'ve come location twice now. first time great second time, else would\\'ve given review four stars. <br><br>the first time visited, ordered cold tofu dessert barley hot grass jelly dessert taro potato balls. took almost hour two desserts come out, tasted good. <br><br>i personally prefer cold grass jelly dessert eating hot grass jelly like drinking soup. tarp sweet potato balls super small hot dessert heat. <br><br>the second time came saturday night around 11. barely line awesome. also take forever dessert come. time around, got classic cold grass jelly dessert loved it. also wanted try brown sugar milk tea ever since came back recent trip taiwan (it\\'s rage there!). brown sugar boba definitely better one yifang\\'s stonestown. 4 stars second visit, 3 stars first. understand they\\'re still fairly new i\\'m sure processes improve. otherwise, i\\'m looking forward coming back!ok everyone soft opening nice! however said staff super slow here, people waiting food people actually eating food. <br><br>place nice big. lots seating available like booths couple tables even solo diner side mirror. lots cute decor. pink wall logo two cute characters front it.<br><br>what liked place many items choose menu. extensive dessert menu drink menu, cool! also liked menu everywhere easy figure get. menus also provide pics descriptions dessert.<br><br>customer service: nonexistent-okay. one register beware long lines. process order get food. came weekday late afternoon. waited 40 mins order waited additional 35 mins get food. dedication desserts.<br><br>anyways order was: pudding mochi milk shaved ice, egg pudding boba, traditional milk tea boba fresh milk tea boba. drinks okay, expecting tea-y, way much boba! dessert good, lots yummy toppings. however needed condensed milk, much shaved ice flavor. <br><br>will back awhile since long wait. hopefully improve wait time desserts!!i came 5 times within week service good.<br>today, waited 40 minutes dessert, whole order wrong. <br>when order extra toppings side (taro balls, winter melon jelly, mini taro balls taro balls filling) would usually put extra cup; however, today, one ladies stuffed everything inside one cup even full.<br>not greatest experience overall. shall return? shall see!there much variety menu desserts pretty tasty. staff wearing ppe enforce facemask requirement. problem drinks allow ice lowest sweetness go 1/3 still pretty sweetthere\\'s one thing really like meet fresh self ordering tablet front store. basically set buzzer pick drink pay without waiting line cashier handle order. think quick easy use. however, anticipate wait 30plus minutes drink- simple milk tea boba arrive. friend surprised long wait going asked cashier made orders. knew store packed sunday afternoon went really seemed lacking staff handle volume orders. milk tea ordered less sweet level bit bitter boba tasted okay. definitely worth wait opinion.food: 4.5 stars - taro balls flavorful, smooth, chewy - best taro balls bay areas meet freshs. came 3 times quality consistent.<br><br>service: 2 stars - clarify, staffs nice polite. however, wait time became unreasonably long. visited first week, wait ~20 mins dessert since ordering. <br><br>we came today ~540, seeing notice \"order food pick ~40 mins.\". &nbsp;this crazy. decided grab dinner wait time. finally got dessert 50 mins wait time, notice got updated 1hour+ order food pickup time. 80%+ tables seated people waiting desserts, ridiculous. expected better better time management seems like doesn\\'t. look forward reasonable speed daly city meet fresh.fav store. dessert authentic def come back. we\\'ve cupertino fremont ones, great see closer one opened. <br><br>one personal side note: fair people like wait wanna get food soon, early give poor review simply due long waiting time. expecting food service part good restaurant always case. expectation simply came early got food 10 mins. <br><br>but def, hope things get smoother future!i\\'ve meet fresh cupertino quality/experience same.<br><br>a lot people complained long lines went random thursday 1pm probably 7 people ahead me... still took forever order. again, likely there\\'s one cashier place order people indecisive want order expansive menu. remember one person ordering bunch desserts decide wanted got wait mind made. <br><br>quality-wise, got thing always get-- cold tofu potato/taro balls. know why, taste good one cupertino. know super subjective maybe went off-day, can\\'t say sure like time.<br><br>in end, think i\\'d go back improve ordering system. wait 25 minutes order felt ridiculous there\\'s 7 people front us.i went store traveling sf. honest, place much crowded new one tried back bellevue waited long time get hot grass jelly. service people nice patient. <br>the food great stores. tasty authentically taiwan flavored! <br>some people think hot grass jelly liquid. like give time cool down. soup magically turn warm smooth delicious jelly! <br>many people give store one star service think unfair. see, trying best improve big fan brand, also would give time! hope everything getting better future. anyway great food deserve wait!i\\'ve tried three desserts one drink, i\\'m happy quality, taste, value. but, main problem prevent going back (at least improve) slow service is, many reviews mentioned.<br><br>i know opened, there\\'s excuse one cashier working, 3 people putting orders together. saw manager expeditor keep store track direct employees, important keep orders moving. <br><br>the ingredients desserts pre-prepared, kept hot/cold containers, staff assemble. staff looked confused moved slowly. literally scooping already-made ingredients bowls, soup style desserts. <br><br>on friday 1 pm, 8 people line me, took 15 minutes order. took 30 minutes get 3 desserts (all favorites list) 1 melon drink go. store full.i pretty excited meet fresh daly city. i\\'ll crave kind dessert offer, lot places around sweethoney dessert colma. <br><br>came tuesday night wait long. waiting cashier take everyone\\'s orders, waiting order. literally took 45 minutes two milk teas. lots regret end, commit. obviously new store efficiency speed come quick, get sense urgency orders.<br><br>the milk tea okay. taro balls delicious though. think i\\'ll stick meet fresh i\\'m craving dessert. chance stop since, think i\\'ll come

lot place exact style taste foodwise drink wise (and people-wise). definitely come give place try share dessert friends. getting one really filling.this place one favorite drinks, unfortunately lack attention detail. i\\'ve ordered black sugar boba milk \"tea\" four different occasions given black sugar boba fresh milk (just milk). drinks look exactly slightly different tint color got home realized. could improve getting actual orders correct every time, would give 5 stars.yummy! sure bad rating. drinks super yummy! server nice too.smaller venue sister cupertino, plenty parking. two separate lines, one cashier one self-pay. typically, recommend cashier self-play go pretty slow even shorter line. grass jelly taro balls. good flavors. main downside wait time. took 15-20min make dessert.giving meet fresh 5 stars selling sesame rice balls. seriously best thing menu lol. usually order 10 orders always give us look &nbsp;lol never fails. i\\'d definitely keep going back those.what cold saturday night? line cold cold dessert. made sense realized arrived 9:30pm...but get dessert 11:00pm. <br><br>now, dessert worth wait? no. there\\'s one person taking orders right now, explains long initial wait. <br>i got signature icy grass jelly ice cream (+$1): sweet potato taro balls grass jelly herbal shaved ice. i\\'ve gotten dessert locations, tasted like it. comes 1 creamer, always ask another one make dessert extra delicious full added calories. guy ended giving 2 extra...so dumped 3 creamers dessert. went straight thighs.<br><br>when finally got order, girl asked wanted ice cream included bowl side. said please put bowl since want ice cream melt grass jelly....it dessert got -___- honestly pet peeve mine. feel like would better ask they\\'re gonna go

okay let\\'s go get sushi i\\'m uni<br>grandma: want it<br>me: %@!*#wtf#$^#$%<br><br>anyways, i\\'ll probably back line lolpricey good. deserve 2.5 stars that\\'s sure. get would 1/3 price taiwan least quality bad venue nice. one bowl $8 tax enough share another person. boba usually 4-5$ per person balances out. <br><br>things i\\'d like see improve: boba 11pm water running anymore (water fixed soon after)<br><br>final verdict: would recommend would come backthere new asian dessert place town chance try last night! husband date night surprised dinner taking here. luckily, beat long lines; literally got 5 minutes line door, main reason since opened. place cute. go counter either order self-serve machine cashier. order, get buzzer find table sit sit bar. hot cold desserts well variety tea options choose from. though \"winter\" bay, decided go q mochi shaved ice. glancing around, expect big was. kid not, husband went pick order buzzer went basically looked cashier believe ours. usually eat shaved ice, would immediately go bottom flavor top usually really unseasoned ice. however, thing like mountain afraid making collapse started top. surprise, get mouthful unseasoned ice, actually got mouthful lightly sweeten, creamy ice loved it! every spoonful ice, sweetness creaminess steeps taste bud even more. mochi jelly came shaved ice great tell made fresh powdery, textured flavorful. topped shaved dried coconut, added lot flavor great. unfortunately, big husband finish it. would recommend shaved ice shared item 4+ friends big enough 4 people. really enjoyed shaved ice can\\'t wait summer come back around try fruit flavored shaved ice!<br><br>it\\'s unfortunate see bad reviews place think mainly sweets america little different sweets asia. lived asia childhood, say desserts way less sweet desserts states. really enjoyed desserts taste freshness ingredients. best part serving portions huge price paid shaved ice.honestly desserts pretty solid opinion. tried taiwanese deserts mainland, kind step down, otherwise pretty great. ice jelly combos nice hot day toppings relatively cheap. never dined ordered take out.inconsistent pricing self ordering in-person ordering. price custom glass jelly-cold ordered self-help kiosk 5.20 (red underlined) person 6.50. cancel self-order kiosk wanted redeem free herbal tea reward. asked, employee simply said know moved on. either trained well, ignorant. however, argue people line thankful free herbal tea rewardi\\'ve location 3 times quality/service deteriorated time. absurdly long wait desserts 99% pre-made ingredients kinda unacceptable. last time waited half hour started make order asked it. nobody behind girls chatting behind counter. single apology girl made drink obviously annoyed work. <br><br>to store manager, enough good product please hire people basic customer service skills (like happy lemon). love desserts probably return anytime soon customer service improved.i\\'ve meet fresh locations one far worst one yet. ordered taro ball tofu pudding like locations, portion give little, literally 2 thin sheets tofu pudding, 6 taro balls full bowl sugar water pudding. &nbsp;i\\'m never coming back again. <br><br>$6.8 definitely rip off.2 drinks 40 mins wait still waiting, probably worst meet fresh store been. problem definitely short staff, seem 5 employee uniform walking around, 1 cashier 2 people working back making orders, others???? chatting kitchen even tho there\\'s lease 10 orders line next cashier.<br><br>this place need serious change, even tho opened recently! good job!i\\'ve cupertino location maybe two, three times they\\'ve always long lines goes way quicker location. &nbsp;theirs 3 people working registers along one self serve kiosk. serramonte location one register get order, see huge counter sea unmade orders. tickets everywhere. <br>that said, shaved ice disappointing. supposed perfect sharing ended eating third 2/3 flavor. mochi sweetness it, neither noodle jelly things. felt like scooped bunch snow put plate. table next us said problem. <br>my drink saving grace. taro inside milk tea mashed form paste good quality taro. 5/5 drink. <br>love phone charges along booths. <br>overall so-so. much prefer cupertino location.went husband yesterday. ordered hot taro #6 raining wanted something warm up. wait wasnt bad order big. problem came slightly warm. eating didnt even warm up. top noodles came fully cooked. aren\\'t. like cooked batch needed toss cook therefore wasnt done rate. i\\'ve attached noodles undercooked. probably something would order ever want something hot. husband tried signature grass jelly one? never failed stick next time.honestly i\\'ve couple meet fresh including socal, southbay, san mateo, definitely worst one. worst mostly service i\\'m guessing, workers responsive attentive. every single time i\\'ve ordered thing: shaved ice. qq jelly, milk pudding, q mochi, taro ball, ice cream, mountain shaved ice. every single time except last 2, they\\'ve gotten order wrong. least 1-2 toppings always left it. closest one house, kept coming back topping flavors textures still consistent, even though expect disappointed time. however, last 2 times fine, would still come back. step game, serramonte meet fresh!bad bad bad ! actually star all. <br><br>don\\'t come taiwanese

sealed ones lid cups. that, store spacious, clean, comfortable.i went second time saturday (first saturday since opened) wait horrific. mean know first weekend they\\'re open, would get slammed customers plan/prepare accordingly? waited line good 30-40 minutes wait food equally long. one point, looked around restaurant one food, everyone waiting. <br><br>anyways, actual dessert, ordered red bean soup #5 grass jelly ice taro balls. red bean soup contains actual red beans...it\\'s watery soup add ins. alright, worth wait. grass jelly good, enjoyed one. texture taro balls perfect.

&nbsp;this place already seemed messy start. friend got #6 red bean, taro chucks, tapioca balls, sweet potato &nbsp;and taro balls. &nbsp;their bowl similar mine, potato ball taro inside, tasted pretty good. &nbsp; taro bowl huge, bowl already huge. &nbsp;my issue place service. &nbsp;when buzzer buzzed, went counter waitress like 2 feet asked mine. &nbsp;she totally ignored me, 2nd waitress came said mine, even smile. &nbsp; issue desserts even hot. &nbsp;meet fresh, know definition hot is? &nbsp;it\\'s adjective means \"having high degree heat high temperature\". &nbsp;why bowl desserts almost cold? &nbsp; wanted cold dessert would\\'ve ordered grass jelly shaved ice! &nbsp;i recommend sharing desserts huge. &nbsp;however, maybe place me, felt mediocre. &nbsp;i feel special, maybe would\\'ve different dessert actually hot.came saturday night 6pm. line short wait. maybe cause smoky air one came out?? sure loved lines like cupertino location. &nbsp;<br><br>taste consistent cupertino location. ordered signature hot grass jelly. yes comes liquid form wait mins let cool turn jelly. also ordered taro ball #4 hot. also good. love put fresh taro inside. also ordered purple rice milk tea. perfect sweetness. <br><br>people can\\'t compare sweet honey. even style. sweet honey hong kong style meet fresh taiwanese style. ignorant people call \"chinese\" dessert.

enjoy desserts drinks! i\\'m big fan qq winter melon tea taro ball #4. highly recommend 2! <br><br>on recent visit, got qq winter melon tea literally waited hour drink .. that\\'s pretty ridiculous .. &nbsp;i got drink, refreshing af, mood anymore waiting hour. <br><br>although really enjoy desserts here, definitely worth wait, especially gonna waiting 30 minutes. i\\'d definitely come back there\\'s wait. <br><br>on another note, customer service exist all, fine. place clearly understaffed - there\\'s 1 cashier long line, 2 others making orders. hopefully place gets together we\\'re waiting hours dessert.as excited store open, i\\'ve already two bad experiences last two visits. first visit lost order waited close hour line 30 minutes food. second last visit, another hour line person behind counter way behind orders looked annoyed there. asked much longer would be, counted 16 orders behind... yep another long wait food would ready! really moving quickly.<br><br>1 star service lack organization 3 stars food.<br><br>i\\'ve stores past (la vancouver) signature grass jelly, qq mochi, peanut/sesame mochi, boba milk tea fresh milk, purple rice taro balls. desserts ok. would prefer boba guys boba however one places fresh grass jelly purple rice, worth giving try. favorite oddly peanut sesame mochi balls. almost lines locations too! <br><br>anyway come visit, prepare wait! think probably skip coming back location get better organized, go ones la whenever visit socal.one favorite desserts nice long day!! meet fresh self order machine, means waiting long line!<br><br>we went around saturday around 2pm &amp; wait. waited around 5-10 mins dessert. <br><br>we got signature ice grass jelly + egg pudding, total came $8.37 pretty worth bowl big! yummy refreshing!i would give negative stars can. worst service, super slow, food drinks taste good. favor stay away.before coming here, saw low ratings place. we\\'ve meet fresh problem. came sunday night (pretty quiet), line started build soon got in. problem cashier, know take order. customers waiting waiting. one guy came help assist taking orders. taking order, got seat waited 10 minutes get food. always get shaved ice, time got pudding &amp; q mochi shaved ice. ice tasted weird sense texturing. rough textured ice. know shaved ice taste , order tasted different. mochi chewy though. anyways, first time trying location. impressed.i really wanted like place. taiwan, great come across franchise serving specialty taiwanese dessert, including things easy come us - signature dish taro balls grass jelly + grass jelly flavored shaved ice unique. unfortunately though, place simply act together terms management customer service. <br><br>we ordered go waited 1 hr 10 min order. fact, everyone else come 30 min us already left. truly took long make dessert scratch, would understand, standing hour observing operations, realized combination ill-managed process staff well-trained customer experience. <br><br>the first thing noticed line place order relatively short - maybe average 5 people line. person counter touch screen order kiosk. however, large crowd people waiting order. 3 people putting together orders, noticed inefficient. scooping items (e.g. taro balls, boba, etc.) drinks desserts, scooping *individually* counting - meaning, example, one given order taro balls, probably scooping 5 6 times slowly. understand need ensure orders receive roughly amount stuff them, people waiting hour food, there\\'s got faster way this. <br><br>secondly, noticed way queued orders place relevant cups / bowls stickers orders desk next staff member put order together. however, amount orders, line orders s-shaped line. meant that, amidst chaos, orders inadvertently bumped moved different spots queue. everyone\\'s orders lost place mixed people\\'s. top that, believe saw different staff member move queue different directions, different staff even working queue order. <br><br>thirdly, instead one person prepping order, appeared split processing type order - meaning, one staff member takes care drinks, another takes care dessert items, forth. logical, downside items prepped faster others order. so, drinks would finished desserts ready another 15 min. would normally fine, except assembly line chaotic, orders mixed people\\'s mentioned above. <br><br>during 70 min time there, followed order 3 times. time, told it\\'d ready 10 min. literally everyone else came us left (we ones left waiting order), followed cashier apologized said he\\'d personally work order immediately. 15 min later, followed again, apologized started it. then, another staff member came attitude, said fault following order earlier. mean, what? followed 3 times ignore order, mindset blame customer \"not following up\" really excellent example poor staff training. top things first place? <br><br>all all, disappointed visit meet fresh. go, prepared wait long time receive order. deceptive cause ordering line might short, backup wait order. lot things work logistically. coming back again.once walk door, line order self serve screen. thought closed cashier better efficiently serve food quicker, i\\'m for. however 30 minutes waiting, knew case. sunday night half tables empty. possibly due two workers making orders , albeit many looks it. workers looked miserable worked tremendously slow leisure. pager finally buzzed, went get order two items. one workers noticed continued ignore presence. worker came back, said \"there\\'s guy picking up\" chinese (assuming think understood chinese). then, noticed order missing add-on taro balls. overall great experience, much contemplation giving place another try.it\\'s definitely higher quality boba desserts, probably worth wait. luckily us, halloween night desert wasteland, 20 minutes waiting orders. definitely agree taro sweet potato balls pretty bland tasteless, even trying discern sort hint they\\'re made of. like drinks tea flavor powerful part drink; however, ratio tea dairy strong enough (or tea hot enough upon mixing) make stronger process pulling flavor milk. could also they\\'re using full fat milk. either way, would come back signature ice jelly...if wait. otherwise, place reminds higher quality creations.decent. got tofu taro balls. weird white chunks taro balls. cupertino location lot better.self/serve option only. workers never looked bother greeting answering questions. thirty minutes slow sunday night. ordered hot dessert herbal tea. order finally ready, wrong. never coming back.finally tried place. got shaved ice. pretty big, bland. fruit fresh hardly flavor. also busy, things came slow.the dessert yummy. <br>the atmosphere nice, even provide outlets cables charge phones.the signature ice grass jelly best one me. although price cheap feel hungry eat it.if mind waiting 1 hour \"okay\" taiwanese dessert, place made you.<br><br>my friends came ~8pm couple people ahead us line. there\\'s one cashier took us 15-20 min order. ordered told would \"almost hour wait\" said we\\'ll get go come back pick (one friend stayed behind keep eye out).<br><br>we back 1 hour later *still done* - keep mind almost 9:30pm close 10. point they\\'ve stopped taking orders tell workers stressed, overworked tired.<br><br>dessert consistent either, friend ordered taro balls tofu pudding mine almost balls tofu opposite. also desserts really watered down.<br><br>+1 star dessert ok, nothing show stopping <br>+1 star poor workers (2 people) making dessertsi really like place tonight totally changed mind.

understanding. made experience enjoyable. &nbsp;<br><br>the decor overall environment clean, modern, comfortable. pretty great groups, too. area place tray done, also sink thought interesting effective way. <br><br>now food. got pudding &amp; q. mochi milk shaved ice fluffy green tea. <br><br>pudding &amp; q. mochi milk shaved ice: cost $9.80, huge! 5 us shared shaved ice still finish &nbsp;(but maybe full tend eat less :/ ). anyways, ice cream top think caramel. there\\'s also mochi, egg pudding, almond pudding, jelly noodles, small sweet potato taro balls. ice expecting expected something fine powdery like bingsu pictures, tasty! sweet overly sweet. toppings added experience. good dessert looking something light still delicious. honest, jelly noodles much taste, gave dish texture. almond pudding favorite grew eating lot, toppings good well. milk taste, like sweet milk flavored boba drinks (if tried that), really like. would definitely come back eat again! 9/10<br><br>fluffy green tea: sooo good! there\\'s strong green tea flavor unlike green milk teas watered down. consistency rich remind something fluffy like name. good. 10/10<br><br>overall, family

taiwanese desserts worth going way for.i\\'ve meet fresh couple times times i\\'d say okay... i\\'m really keen huge fan shaved ice desserts similar may also affect judgement.<br><br>it girlfriend\\'s first time though always wanted try long time finally time check last saturday night. first experience place weekday right lunch co-worker mine. walked parking, got line ordered within 5 minutes got orders nom-nom-nomed away. saturday night however completely different experience though. might trifecta went saturday night, diamond jamboree, there\\'s plethora asians irvine, either students uci local residents. <br><br>although line looked long, progressed pretty quick. 3 huge screens order screens apparently encompass whole menu. apparently also couple ipads wall mounted customers use figure want, reason missing... hmmm, wonder why? <br><br>between two us, ordered drinks shared shaved ice. here\\'s low thought item:<br><br>taro ball tofu pudding (3/5): added grass jelly mix since stuff. first bite without coconut milk bad, thought pretty blan taste overall. figured, \"hey, maybe coconut milk help?...\" although give coconut kick bite, enough make go \"ohhhh yeahhhh... s#!* right here!\" mochi... taste pretty much utter disappointment. <br><br>winter melon tea w/ lemon juice (2/5): i\\'ll say ohh glad girlfriend\\'s drink! tried out, first reaction \"ohh wow that\\'s tangy!\" decided give try exaggerating! moment liquid touches tongue, get sour taste put much lemon juice enough sweetness compensate. taste lingers bit wash taro milk tea. unless sour tastes sensations, i\\'d say avoid drink.<br><br>taro milk tea (3/5): probably best thing i\\'ve meet fresh thus far. i\\'m saying anything different great, taro taste overwhelming strong feared would be. anything, typical milk tea taste hint taro small bits taro sip. <br><br>although can\\'t speak girlfriend\\'s behalf, i\\'d say meet fresh bit overhyped overrated. i\\'m sure better places irvine area get better shaved ice cheaper cost shorter wait times.definitely great dessert place!<br>however, matter great toilet dirty unkempt, makes place better garbage dump!so came sunday (18th) two friends sushi dinner. came around 9:45pm line door. still, decided wait since two friends wanted try place. <br><br>this would 3rd time here. ordered cold meet fresh signature, herbal grass jelly, taro balls,

staffs still learning ropes business. really like clean, brightly lit, spacious setting cafe well creative decorations (i.e., cloud-shaped meshes hanging ceiling). definitely would recommend place anyone needs good dessert anytime they\\'re area.we got mango &amp; passion fruit green tea fluffy grass jelly slush.<br>was told former tasted like water. latter cookies &amp; cream taste. &nbsp;not fan cream (strong w/ aftertaste) &amp; slush all. finish it. rating strictly taste, i\\'ll add service slow (20+ min) tuesday 7pm even though virtually empty.i see place highly rated quality taste deserves. reviewers correct frequently line wait time quite long (thus docking 1 star). however, parents taught best things life worth waiting for, waited quite time. <br><br>their extensive menu

enjoyable experience. also got mango shaved ice gargantuan. really warning menu one - meant 3 people. even though huge, really end eating middle part cause plain ole ice. outside first couple layers damn delicious. worth $13-$15 price (i forgot around there)?<br>only decide that.<br><br>overall, worth try there\\'s line. likely place frequent. oh temper expectations, sugar end all.i\\'m little review - i\\'m super confident i\\'m semi-white-washed following along.<br><br>i say, firstly, place huge. san mateo rent, must gotten amazing deal space worth them.<br><br>anyway.<br><br>so lines usually long. move pretty slowly. like one cashier slowly. first time came here, 10-15 minutes per person. 30 min (and 2 people), left.<br><br>the second time, yes came back lead ridiculous sweet tooth, like 30 min whole line. really know got two shaved ices (which relatively big) share.<br><br>besides wait, found seats waited desserts. came, definitely different traditional american dessert - overall really liked finished it. hence 4 star. <br><br>i\\'m guessing reviews depends get who\\'s working night - reliable sense especially friends, worst case, least there\\'s lot options san mateo meet fresh takes long.been recently seems like quality better before. might end sticking icy grass jelly signature go-to location actually give plenty taro balls! eating icy grass jelly signature

minutes. i\\'ve tried:<br><br>-fluffy green tea ($4.50 + $0.50 grass jelly): wow, green tea super strong. ordered 1/3 sweet, less ice, drink sweet all. would definitely recommend 50% sweetness offset bitterness (this coming someone normally orders 25% sweetness boba spots). <br>-pudding &amp; q mochi milk shaved ice (almond pudding, caramel pudding, mini taro balls, jelly noodle, q mochi, ice cream, $11.80), <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=x7hihjc4gj488uwpy1ksqq&amp;userid=76vifzcc7owykcbjmfgvxg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot…</a>): finally found something really like

exciting.<br>-sesame mochi ($1): yuck. reason, strong herbal taste mochi, good. mochi nice sticky, sesame flavor subtle barely sweetness. herbal smell also stayed eating it- skip!<br>-peanut mochi ($1): slightly better sesame mochi, one similar issues. herbal note/flavor, sweet enough. peanut flavor good (when could taste it), order again.<br><br>meet fresh extensive menu, tons different options. i\\'ll back try shaved ice grass jelly series! parking downtown san mateo tough lunch dinner rushes, street parking available well parking lots.uber eats it! fast delicious! go taro balls

15 minutes make. again, line. back up. <br><br>painfully slow poor customer service.overrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrratedddddddd<br><br>the staff slow food overrated, also super stingy portions toppings. meat fresh(es) i\\'ve gone efficient also able get ice center flavor, san mateo location initial flavoring outside make way center ice ... well tastes... like plain old ice... like eating patch snow, pretty disappointing pricethe problem chain service damn slow. slow oakland, slow san mateo, slow daly city. watch behind counter see system putting things together. workers place instead smooth assembly line.this place popular! seating full, line long service slow. already dinner wanted drink dessert took 20 minutes. got black sugar fresh milk boba pretty good. boba nice chewy. wished put little brown sugar could little sweeter me. <br><br>but overall, decent. would come back less people service improves.closer 3.5 stars(for now). familiar, already know meet fresh locations bay area(cupertino, daly city come mind). new location san mateo open since late september may soft opening mode still, least hope so, operations wait times location pretty.<br><br>being located downtown san mateo blessing curse. they\\'re centrally located many restaurants shops, however parking congestion aggravating time.<br><br>i almost always order meet fresh signature(cold), grass jelly shaved ice base, grass jelly top, finally taro balls top that. simple refreshing dessert. unfamiliar taro balls dessert, imagine boba\\'s consistency chewiness. surely back throughout winter, here\\'s hoping streamline operations side house pronto.quality pretty consistent meet fresh locations. service sucks. one thing hate meet fresh take minimum adjustment products. example, can\\'t adjust sugar level milk tea cuz pre-made. can\\'t exchange toppings.<br><br>they messed order forgetting charge toppings. went warn charge extra make drink, need start again. answer got \"i refund whole order charge again\". umm.. legit creating scene holding line. seriously? hard add toppings pour pre made milk tea cup charge one extra dollar? giving chance make right, clearly wanna take it.<br><br>i wanna blame servers, management, train staff properly.i sorry, second time wait horrendous, busy toooooo slow.<br>sorry, back here..<br>this message management speed things up.....<br>:(hey pepe g... 15 minutes dessert? &nbsp;we must\\'ve waited 20+ minutes went inquire delay later patrons seemed getting theirs. &nbsp;the guy say word looked around pager# &nbsp;order. &nbsp;after another 10 minutes went ask fortunately soon ready. &nbsp;but stood recvd drink, one word again. &nbsp;not one \"sorry\"... one word. &nbsp;these workers like aliens. &nbsp;no personal skills probably communicate devices. &nbsp;no class. &nbsp;and strange name place... buh-bye.normally would give meet fresh location 4 stars, however location slow inefficient operations cannot higher 3 stars book, least now.<br><br>they\\'re located downtown san mateo, convenient frustrating time. convenient lots places catch meal dessert. frustrating parking extremely challenging times. would surprised said took 20 minutes circling around blocks find parking spot. location, actually nice bright, large space. seems plenty seating. <br><br>now, bad part, time takes order terrible times day. terrible part long takes call collect order. first experience took 40 minutes slow sunday early evening. second time, busy saturday evening, took nearly long. could argue they\\'re getting better suspect they\\'re still ironing wrinkles operations.this location taiwanese drink / dessert chain old bank america space, quite spacious high ceilings inside, nice place share desserts catch friends. major gripe everything ordered came lukewarm. ever red bean almond based soup desserts, know enjoyed extremely hot otherwise tastes like sugar water. pretty disappointed chain notoriously cheap, expect take care providing temperature management line franchise standards. overall better experience cupertino fremont locations.i taking away star let play board games here. :(<br><br>otherwise, really like place.<br><br>this place packed friday night 20-30 people line front me. love appreciated efficient staff hard working. really mind waiting this.<br><br>i love purple rice milk tea.<br>i love shaved ice.<br>i love boba.<br><br>there\\'s little love, except board game thing...prefer daly city location one one longer wait. addition, came 15mins closing, paid cash given change \"they allowed take cash change\". say anything paid? could\\'ve let know. &amp; cash register still full officially close? mean, mind giving extra change courtesy least let customer know. biggie, something stood upon experience now.management needs read review get act together. waiting half hour, finally asked order was. said noodle jelly would take another 18 minutes. serious? milk tea worth waiting 48 minutes for. tell us beginning?located former hsbc bank downtown san mateo (diagonally across north beach pizza), there\\'s street metered parking paid parking garages downtown. seating cupertino location spacious daly city location great groups. outdoor seating. cute cloud decor making use high ceilings. self-ordering system rewards program yet setup. credit cards accepted.<br><br>my go usually hot tofu pudding,

every time come, service quite slow. would order online pickup via ubereats hour beforehand arrive store 15-30 minutes receiving notification order ready would still take 15-30 minutes receive items. also noticed customers experience lag comes orders ready pickup causes considerable buildup amount people waiting inside restaurant, safe times.there\\'s lot hate meet fresh\\'s timeliness, bad consider new are, many customers they\\'re serving, delightful customer experience ambience is. <br><br>for cleanliness customer service, they\\'d get 5. however, food/drinks overpriced mediocre hence 3. <br><br>5/5 cleanliness + ambience + customer service: even long line, cashiers happy help normal person feel better about. <br><br>3/5 prices: nothing rave home about, wonder paid for. felt trying snow ice milk tea. <br><br>3/5 quality: excited try black sugar fresh milk boba, except 90% milk... $6 tax, overkill. boba, however, pretty good clearly steeped sugar mixture similar taiwan\\'s. lot

decent amount toppings. $9 per bowl, feel like get spoonfuls toppings.enjoyed rendition hot red bean soup. signature hot red bean soup contained plenty goodies including 2 sesame rice balls (delish), taro pieces, taro balls (2 colors) boba (aka tapioca) thick (not sweet), well-simmered blended soup. improvement think maybe introduce kind crunch/texture offset overall smoothness.came dessert dinner know santa clara location. pretty empty quiet unlike nearby locations, like. ordered kiosk easy use although chinese characters bit confusing. got grass jelly special share<br><br>grass jelly special (4/5): really good wish bit sweeter cream flavoring ice.<br><br>meet fresh always place heart favorite taiwanese dessert place. definitely come back herefirst time trying meet fresh boba tad annoying

soft chewy--definitely fresh! shaved ice could still use work still rough crunchy textured rather soft snowy like associate shaved ices be. either way, i\\'m giving additional star previous review tasty mochi kindness workers get partner hooked wi-fi. <br><br>for anyone wants get wifi, seems like ask employee get wifi!to honest...there many places bay area sell boba, teas, skushies, mochi waffles way better tasting rated franchise. flavors give place 4 5 star review. place students get together yet experience real boba house sit mingle. tofu inside drinks odd love tofu ... tea overbrewed ... add jellys boba exactly expect. &nbsp;the waffles make always cooked.love i\\'m closer meet fresh now. plenty parking plaza. enter store, might think closed pretty quiet; employees hang back self-order interact picking something. location system meet fresh i\\'ve scan app order online use one stations inside store. stations bottle hand sanitizer next it, that\\'s nice. wish system better description different desserts instead squinting really hard photos, overall, worst system. automatically prints receipt done ordering sign asks wait outside. <br><br>even though one time, wait cook sesame balls, desserts ready, texted phone. upon arriving home, bit spill (the lid tightly way guess) bottom bag bit sticky. <br><br>the desserts always good! love icy jelly mini taro balls consistent whenever go complaints!<br><br>pros: consistent delicious desserts. love different options have. minimal interaction employees want any!<br><br>cons: make sure lids sealed transporting home. minimal interaction employees could problem wanted friendly greet walk in.food great, server\\'s attitude needs improved. <br>i would definitely going back food milktea.we usually go meet fresh cupertino closed day went here. line nice cupertino meet fresh usually huge line. ordered icy grass jelly taro balls, ice cream taro paste. boyfriend ordered icy taro balls. quite long wait food come out. go ask ready yet started making it. think many online orders perhaps. food came out, good. place provides large good portion taro paste compared locations. creamy delicious. ice cream came melty guess that\\'s okay made grass jelly creamy. taro balls nice squishy. grass jelly refreshing detoxifying. location looks nice cute decor.was excited try new mf. placed order kiosk asked clerk make drink less sweet. probably misheard passion fruit tea grossly overly sweet. ended throwing away. kids gobbled egg waffle redeeming factor. egg waffles came cute box. wait tad long, probably understaffed, that\\'s understandable.this review/rating average first two visits - first visit decided use app order case wait long (app ordering process great/wait time fine (approx. 15 min). <br><br>however got there, handed different order mine...they realized gave order someone else. ordered winter melon lemon tea realizing mistake - also informed us winter melon drink gave wrong person also last cup would need brew new one me. waited 20min new brew made. result: drink actually quite good despite everything. <br><br>second visit: ordered 2 winter melon drinks taro egg waffle - time ordered person issues order wait time fine. however drink quality good first (tasted much diluted). egg waffles warm/had good texture taro flavor would probably get regular one next time. <br><br>seeing new-ish hope able improve quality service consistency drinks/snacks here!so happy opened backyard - download app order arrive, long orders 6:30pm. &nbsp;note also location, currently open thur-sun.<br><br>the menu extensive, get all... now, initial impressions:<br><br>1. signature ice grass jelly<br>grass jelly rooibos tea based jello give big lump it, along looks like two dozen choices toppings - served ice hot! &nbsp;i believe chose boba lychee jelly accompany jelly. &nbsp;next time i\\'ll get red/mung beans and/or sesame rice balls. &nbsp;<br><br>2. boba tofu pudding<br>the pudding flavor pronounced, expect normally put pudding drinks. &nbsp;it\\'s subtle, yet still refreshing.<br><br>3. oolong milk tea<br>good, noticeably unique outstanding. &nbsp;i would come boba drinks.<br><br>4. sesame mochi<br>packed beautifully, thought outside dusted aroma flavor resembled coffee grinds black sesame. &nbsp;on palate, sesame flavor muted, gooey center finally discover pronounced flavors. <br><br>my next trip explore red bean dishes perhaps caramel pudding.update: latest order icey taro signature. ice amount way usual. see photo. even though requested low ice amount.they really take time making orders...we waited 35 mins finally got order 1 item - tofu pudding rice balls. that\\'s 2 ingredients!! think would take long put two together. <br><br>the tofu pudding lacked flavor bit gritty, smooth like imagined. soup bland, sweet (we got regular sweetness). rice balls best part guess, nice chewy texture think might\\'ve made dough sugar tasted sweeter broth itself. <br><br>they anyone working register order using self-order machines online.first time today soon walked empty, around 6:30 pm. asked order kiosk big deal place empty.writing review

you.<br><br>lastly, anyone who\\'s considering try shop, give honest opinion: waste time money. shop taiwanese people approve.<br><br>finally, taiwanese homies: <br>幹他媽超難吃，別來。this meet fresh location opened, maybe they\\'re still going adjustment period, info online (website app) incorrect store hours online ordering. managed order boba tea, cold soft tofu taro, sesame mochi. tea anywhere else, like fantasia across parking lot, tofu dessert bland. ordered regular sweetness level, maybe need bump up. mochi ok, weirdly gelatinous outside, deep sesame flavor middle. parking challenging rivermark, aware. otherwise, try place again, menu opens more, get bearings.great! ordered hot grass jelly sweet potato tofu pudding taro ball. actually gave us fresh taro instead taro ball, that\\'s okay - tasted delicious. taste two desserts unique, bit different cupertino location. would say \"homemade\" less appealing eye, whereas cupertino location serves like \"chain restaurant\" - good, different taste. staff look little bit disorganized still working things - let\\'s give time! far reviewers commenting rude, honestly think cultural thing - people grew parts east asia come \"cold\" \"rude\". that\\'s culture ways - nothing bad it.great service clean little boba shop great atmosphere! love easy order touch-screen menu option order bobaristas well. appreciate many toppings choose from, especially since offer caramel pudding taro balls! ordered black sugar boba drink pearls cooked perfect consistency. fan brown sugar boba, black sugar pretty much same. manager nayun also

lunch, meet fresh happened across street restaurant coming from.<br><br>the place busy time entered, ordering screens select desserts wait come out. staff actually encourages customers order touch screen, although one counter could order in-person. found system fairly-organized, despite line touch screen-- gripe store could add least another touch screen, since two rush hour enough.<br><br>i opted icy taro ball, although made mistake ordering extra toppings, know dish already came plenty toppings! ended taking extra toppings to-go, sweet potato balls soft, chewy, hint sweet potato paste inside.<br><br>the icy taro ball solid itself, toppings fresh chewy. much shaved ice me, best eat it. staff preparing dishes quick, organized, efficient, impressive given sunday post-lunch rush.<br><br>overall, decent desserts. again, thing i\\'d suggest adding least another touch screen customers they\\'re going us use self-service machines, since two enough busy hours.they one best milk teas! crave time. icy grass jelly really good, would definitely say acquired taste :)i love meet fresh i\\'m sure low rating yelp. every time come here, dessert timely manner desserts always consistent every time. came saturday thanksgiving. offering deal purchase icy grass jelly signature taro paste ube paste (forgot actual name) get free hot grass jelly soup signature. delicious. love icy grass jelly signature also love taro plus me. also super cold night hot dessert delicious really warmed us up. two desserts price one always steal.for second time row, guys forgot put winter melon jelly almond soup. first time almond soup combo c, awesome. decided go back yesterday, realized winter melon jelly. went today, course guys forgot again. come guys.<br>also, need complete order little faster. make sense people wait 15 minutes many workers there. side store filled customers waiting order smh.i\\'m stop coming even though think serve good desserts. problem desserts drinks serve. even mind $10 order now. place ran poor management. they\\'re short staffed employees care. there\\'s efficient system point sale final product. <br><br>you order two touch screen kiosks, front cashier, online. except ordered one kiosks, even print receipt. literally printed blank ticket. brought employee, go ribbon receipts figure order number was. even provide proof purchase. point, employee tag machine order, instead 20 people ordering kiosk. biggest problem one got receipt proof purchase. <br><br>i waited longer lunch across parking lot, 40 minutes something takes less 5 assemble. got text get order counter, even ready. employee behind counter look stacks empty cups confirm order number ready. ticket system nightmare. <br><br>they either need space assemble, better organization system, limit points sale. i\\'d rather wait line order already pay something unexpectedly wait 40 minutes. actually feel bad employees, bunch angry people waiting order, asking check order taking time away actually making orders.i came wednesday night. took 45 minutes get 4 items. slow service. like specially cook / prepare dessert. asked speak manager, ignored. <br>food mediocre. worth wait cost.icy grass jelly.<br><br>not sweet always fan favorite.<br><br>i really enjoyed dessert sharing family best thing!meet fresh one favorite places refreshing dessert. huge variety desserts choose customize toppings want!!<br><br>we decided try double taro signature purple rice signature. double taro definitely favorite meet fresh refreshing grass jelly shaved ice. comes topped ice cream, mochi balls, taro paste goes perfectly creamer add top. sweet perfect combination.<br><br>the purple rice signature also bomb. youre mood grass jelly still want something cold, move. purple rice one favorites loved twist classic meet fresh toppings.i usually order winter melon tea mini taro balls whenever come meet fresh. came recently completely winter melon tea. pretty disappointed decided try something else anyways. one bowl desserts back biggest fan. remembered loving toppings especially caring whatever sauce poured everything. decided give bowl desserts another try ordered icy taro ball signature i\\'m glad did! absolutely love taro everything bowl. super refreshing, overly sweet toppings perfectly chewy. issue visit ordered one bowl wait pretty long. i\\'m still obsessed i\\'m glad found another go to!my brother mom highly recommended place, excited give try them.<br><br>we ordered black sugar boba milky shaved ice pudding &amp; q mochi milk shaved ice sesame balls taro added it. mom ended getting two nougat crackers too, taste expecting. ended stopping sunmerry waiting shaved ice made.<br><br>we ended eating car since outdoor seating went past weekend. definitely large portions good dessert share others. black sugar boba milky shaved ice came foam tastes like thai tea. liked foam, big fan black sugar boba one trying pudding &amp; q mochi milk shaved ice since latter many different textures toppings sweet. liked digging around find next surprise eat, like mochi shaped logs sesame balls added order.<br><br>overall, good eating experience definitely stick getting pudding &amp; q mochi milk shaved ice hehei know desserts q mochi &amp; pudding shaved ice bombdiggity. girlfriend get large cause we\\'re fatties, worth diabetesthe self order kiosk show drinks broken, went counter order. guy taking orders friendly. service sooooooo l w! watched make orders move slowly sense urgency. 5 workers understand longer wait times due lots orders, could least walk little faster. also took many breaks orders stand around talk. <br><br>once order ready, could barely hear girl call number slammed bag counter walked away. asked another guy worker mine replied \"yeah\" attitude walked away. <br><br>we got home toppings wrong. receipt drink clearly states boba yet got lychee jelly. 2 completely different things. make mistakes moving slow speed? give customers attitude after?? <br><br>the good things taste drinks cashier.i\\'d like start saying actually enjoy desserts here. go-to usually form hot/icy grass jelly, everything usually cooked perfectly - chewy, tender, delicious. past time, hot grass jelly lack bit flavor, i\\'d say overall get 4-4.5/5 based solely food. never going good taiwan, good enough la.<br><br>now crappy part. others pointed out, location really busy, busy, also extremely disorganized. needs better system picking to-go orders. often times sift orders counter, still pandemic i\\'m sure would prefer bags touched strangers. also used online system many times estimates waaay off, actually couple times received \"ready pick up\" text message 1-2 hours already picked order (and store actually closed). additionally, two occasions showed staff even aware placed online order (but add always quick remedy this).<br><br>the worst part once, twice forgotten add extra taro balls order, even though explicitly states there\\'s extra side taro balls ticket that\\'s stuck bowl. that\\'s little absurd, considering charge $1 little add-on. realize get home, late go back due distance store closing. know, know, always check order leaving... really supposed take lid every time sift contents make sure got taro balls? know could bottom bowl. final note regarding online orders: always leave note stating utensils extra peanuts, seems gets ignored well. little attention detail helps.<br><br>overall, i\\'d say staff looks busy, they\\'ve always kind interactions. kudos keeping together stressful environment. place dire need better system/management.food good. service bad. would blame staff maybe short-staff management. look photo bowl desert think ok present customers, well guess dont enough time even consider. hopefully staffs organized afterall.i know accept pics advertisement different reality. missing something here? taro balls? boba?<br><br>edit: hi angela, yes correct, last pic attached product. deleted reattached correct pic. sorry misrepresentation.<br><br>edit2: meet fresh reached immediately rectify problem. thank angelathis place great covid. ever since covid serve products go cups

order ready, get message pickup. <br><br>my desserts hot desserts. favorite almond milk red beans. winter, hot almond milk supposedly good stomach. red beans, immune system get stronger. need helps pandemic time.this meet fresh keeps getting worse worse... decided come back family craving ordered jasmine green tea melon jelly, tell random bits taro inside drinks. definitely cross contamination used pick toppings. floor work in, flooded water everything unsanitary. also ordered oolong milk tea boba grass jelly...and boba... <br><br>i would drive extra mile go meet fresh santa anita mall know wassup.for covid precautions felt safe. line ordering one pickup. cautious ordered app entered store picking order. service tad slow estimated time ready pretty exact. said ready 30min really get text ready 30min mark.<br><br>i got oolong milk tea grass jelly. love grass jelly here. soft. also got sesame mochi mung bean cake. also soft fresh. surprising flavor mochi..seems made brown sugar. unique. overall everything really good.<br><br>the staff friendly.<br>besides wait time, overall experience goodbeen numerous times many occasions friends usually visiting town. &nbsp;i love place. &nbsp;the desserts varied great. &nbsp;i always get grass jelly, though tofu, almond desserts shaved ice. &nbsp;recently, put ordering machine somewhat cumbersome makes things bit less efficient - actual cashier preferred.my first time location. busy monday night! small parking lot hard find parking. stood long line noticed sign said \"order online faster service\" started ordering app successfully accomplished. got line checked email see 35 min wait! shocked also surprised time knowing many people inside restaurant. lying really take 35 minutes. note self others already know getting order app leave pick up. <br><br>i got favorite - pudding q mochi shaved ice (large $12) always get go meet fresh notice location added lychee jelly pleasant surprise. liked it.so disappointed poor customer service incorrect order. acknowledge even stand front counter asking assistance. paid extra additional topping even put order. unfortunately find mistake gotten home to-go order.<br>what mess!why paper bag drinks? please simply use brain!!! cup holder? bags? business again!came dessert lunch friends! <br><br>* original egg waffle (4/5) - made fresh order, crispy outside soft inside! choice add toppings inside well. <br>* black sugar boba milk tea (4/5) - could really taste tea flavor, brown sugar sweet since got 1/2 sweet, boba cooked rightthe boba still chewy next day! place amazing! ordered black milk tea sugar boba 50% sugar. boba bottom kinda warm first time mix it, right temperature texture soooo great. milktea okay guess. quality boba impressive. think revisit place.i know hard find employees right cashier today untrained felt like could\\'ve went behind counter done far better job serving customers.<br><br>i ordered signature red bean soup togo paid extra $1 add sesame rice ball. add more. top that, also forgot add taro.<br><br>sad.my go place asian desserts. serve taiwanese desserts boba, everything good! go-to orders include shaved ice (large positions!), grass jelly (both iced hot tasty), hot almond soup, tofu hua. love variety various toppings choose from. place always hits spot !i went try meet fresh recently sister. got taro shaved ice think sister got mango one. got line lot people sitting eating. busy, used kiosk order told us going text message pick order. so, went walk around text message came like 15 mins. think fast girl helped us really nice well. i\\'m sure hot weather shaved ice melted right got soon turned water. that, would recommend place good fast would faster order ahead online something.have always loved meet fresh temple city tonight order, cut fingernail mouth!!! absolutely unacceptable, gonna cut nail bite least outside away food prepped. absolutely disgusted!i really hate writing bad reviews damn location disappointing. waiting order, noticed unhappy customers asking refunds. continued order assumed people impatient. hour since entered building... milk tea grass jelly, know worth waiting long . <br><br>update: waited 1 hour time order 1 hour 30 minutes entering building. gave us another drink compensation wait time.not best experience. went looking menu, question (an ingredient question food allergy) stood front counter staff member cashier ignored even saying \"excuse me\" multiple times walked away. waiting someone else come \"busy\" making drinks. stood counter bit longer waiting someone come nobody seemed want help us. decided forget question order kiosk bit disheartening blatantly ignored us. ordered drinks came pretty quick. drinks okay, friend ordered black milk tea agreed tasted bit watered sweet friend ordered ube milk tea said good overly sweet. overall, positive experience hope one time thing little busy still excuse bad service.every time come here, there\\'s long wait. everyone waiting order 2 active employees working orders. went yesterday tried mobile order accept order twice. saw small sign saying hour wait. sign obvious spot employees speak it. <br><br>there\\'s also issue substituting items even though things ran out. came months ago lot toppings ran out. expected pay full price half toppings. wanted order item substitute unavailable items others employees kept saying can\\'t substitute items. 3/6 toppings come it!!! makes absolutely sense less half original toppings ask customers pay extra toppings. order supposed around $7 ended $9. add \"extra\" toppings, would order half toppings supposed come it. full price. really cheating customers. absolutely disgusting service employees. guys need figure system works customers. <br><br>other times would come even tell order. everyone waits counter nobody would notified order ready. order sitting 10 minutes practically melted. <br><br>i\\'m sure locations way would give location 0 choice.you place pick order app. deliver via food delivery apps well. store, really easy place order using self service kiosks order cashier. decent selection drinks desserts pick from. love grass jelly desserts. also like tofu pudding. herbal tea sweet side opinion.that ordering machine extremely slow glitchy. huge line order machine machine would glitch every customer. understand can\\'t regular cashier taking orders. food good good enough justify terrible customer service. coming back.<br><br>i forgot mention. wait get glitchy machine, think wait long food. all, food requires pretty much preparation, matter assembling dessert bowls. wrong. waited forever 3 dessert bowls. definitely coming back.with covid-19, would expected cleaning process. order store, 2 touch screens order from. pick drinks &amp; pay without cashier. wipe person uses it. hand sanitizer side, still.<br><br>the drinks good size price $4.50. personally think i\\'ll back pandemic.this location\\'s customer service management underwhelming unprofessional. family ordered desert week night. waited 20<br>minute get thing. asked store showed receipt. questioned receipt another location. imagine that...i like meet fresh disappointed quality service. third time toppings missing. first time happened, i\\'m like fine... oops. second time, i\\'ll give chance. third time, i\\'ve it. looking forward drink go home find missing toppings, always boba! frustrating i\\'m losing confidence ordering something location again. want pay something end giving me.this place bonkers. good way. order ahead website super slick smooth. highly recommend order ahead lines still look long peak hours like weekends post dinner. <br><br>there 15 min parking pickup orders strip mall. get text order ready pickup. love signature shaved ice grass jelly tofu desserts. many options menu let specify sweetness, ie control pre diabetic diet. <br><br>my experience staff service significantly improved since last time here. much i\\'ve already come 3x past week! <br><br>there indoor seating though limited. there\\'s seating outdoor shared patio (shared restaurants seems, seating appears agnostic particular restaurant). so, take meet fresh tables. bear mind there\\'s always shade heating. <br><br>enjoy. meet fresh favorite new addiction.- employees consistently rude unwelcoming <br>- pick phone<br>- employees even know menu explain difference drinks <br>*just go different location store together trust me!!*second time coming here. first time got drinks tasted like diluted water. decided give second chance dessert since saw many customers order dessert overt drinks. got dessert (taro balls) disappointed , $8 bowl? pretty bland, tasteless. supposed add sugar bowl? get asked much sugar wanted? &nbsp;the ice bland too. forget add something? sure, done here. hate leave bad review disappointed price too, expected better.quick service, nice staff, great flavors! first tried type desserts &nbsp;when taiwan wanted try back la. much menu, going trying different ones see one like familiar. order hot cold pretty cool.the desserts little pricey side mind since taste desserts pretty good.<br>i looked reviews hand cause would checked order leaving. ordered 4 different desserts 2 missing items inside. paid premium topping receive either.the drinks good like them. usually enjoy boba milk teas tea like flavor meet fresh definitely satisfies that. mini taro balls make drink absolutely amazing too.<br><br>i\\'m giving place 3 star ordering system wait system. two ordering kiosk inside honestly needs work. <br>first all, ui naming scheme needs improvement. usually order milk tea mini taro balls, confused look it. click \"c milk tea mini taro balls\" assume \"c\" stands classic. really need put c front? c could stood like chocolate, creamy, etc<br>second all, waiting system terrible. like 90+ degrees ordering, tell wait outside. there\\'s enough room inside remove chairs tables make waiting room. today, people pretending order get chewed out, slowing ordering process. <br><br>if want avoid process, believe order online honestly, feel like unless place super popular not. there\\'s 3 people today still wait couple minutes place order. traffic jam 3 people 2 kiosks. <br><br>tldr, good drink taro milk tea, prepared wait suni love meet fresh! favorite dessert spot ever, love black rice ones mochi balls served hot. hours always fantastic!after going once, i\\'m give another fair review. think signature icy grass jelly okay. paid 8.54 taxes. waited around like 15 minutes order keep mind, lot people store well. think certainly good dessert place eat pretty affordable get. creamer give pretty good enough. taro balls grass jelly also good, taro chewy grass jelly tasted normal. overall, pretty average place dessert eating main course like kang ho dong baekjeong summer rolls restaurant within plaza.parking<br>the parking situation super easy located big plaza plenty underground parking.<br><br>things get<br>if first time definitely try icy grass jelly desserts taro balls. wintermelon fresh milk tea also one favorites. everything overly sweet. tastes refreshing.<br><br>wait<br>lines get super long suggest ordering ahead delivery app ordering inside using kiosk &nbsp;instead waiting line someone take order. came weekday night around 9pm wait 25 minutes prepare one wintermelon milk tea drink super ridiculous opinion.came dessert drinks. first opened super popular, think desserts drinks average. got warm tofu pudding rice balls, 2/3 sweet sweet mostly syrup. container large half full tofu. red bean green tea waffle looked perfectly golden brown, crispy top soggy bottom, disappointing. winter melon tea delicious refreshing.miss hangout spot! used frequent place often friends. since popular place, would quick save table since orders would take time make. enjoyed different versions icy grass jelly, shaved ice, teas. one day, things go back normal...<br><br>anyhoo, pandemic, ordered online social distanced picnic ago. super convenient always appreciate packed food drinks. pick quick hassle-free. ordered herbal teas, winter melon teas, limited special taro slush. everything made personal preferences noted order, everybody happy!<br><br>as individual treat lately, i\\'ve enjoyed hot red bean soup signature signature icy grass jelly separate occasions. good! thing bit disappointing 2 taro pieces red bean soup. soft enough still decent enough eat. sweet potato taro balls totally point! love freshness chewiness. totally

outside space, get pretty hot summer. <br><br>the icy stuff survived 10 minute ride home. careful open caramel pudding container pretty fitting may spill some...like did.i highly recommend ordering ahead mobile app, wait times outside also desserts long hot days.<br><br>meet fresh good job following public health orders. separate ordering pick-up two different sections. also heavily enforce six-foot distance patrons.<br><br>as dessert, meet fresh employees great job making packing orders. make sure read notes mobile orders make corrections/additions desserts.there many things changed here. first, ordering machine. machine user friendly. many people familiar system, lot people waiting. lines long. secondly, prices way now. pandemic, spend $8 single order. whatever pictured menu, get. now, soup base $8, add $1 per item add like taro balls, boba, mochi balls, red beans, etc. end spending $14 per order. good business. shut down!!2 stars understaff.<br><br>employees greeted nice.<br><br>however, expected wait single dessert going ~hour.we came meet fresh meet friend. first time parking tough. parking spots really tight see large cars parked them; guess spot spot. planning try underground parking got lucky saw car leaving. <br><br>there two entrances: one west side building one south side. order counter directly front south side entrance. several seating locations throughout building order counter kitchen centered middle. restrooms located east side building towards back. <br><br>we ordered milk tea, jasmine tea, red bean mochi ball. accept apple pay (woohoo) gave us pager would light vibrate order ready. grabbed table chatted pager went off. pick counter located left order counter sign says \"pick up\" (it\\'s decorated hanging red lanterns). <br><br>the teas tasty. sister enjoyed milk tea; said good amount sweetness. jasmine tea flavor profile good enjoyable. unfortunately, bit sweet liking; i\\'ll ask could make less sweet next time. done, return tray return station located left pick location. <br><br>overall, good experience meet fresh. occupied table quite caught friend enjoyed drinks. ambience lively times noise level bit loud. nice comfortable place hang out.edited: replying meet fresh team well, received text informing online order dact ready, 7:50pm?!!! placed online order car 4:45pm! 3 hours make one simple order, custom order. wow, thanks. <br><br>i rarely write reviews feel like to. employees soo rude! daughters quickly ordered online parked says \"ready 38mins\" i\\'m like oh wow that\\'s long decided wait inside anyway, tried get workers attention ask ordered machine inside, would faster? one acknowledges you, one girl looked looked away. said excuse nothing. holding 1 year old daughter arms, got impatient.

find spot. &nbsp;you either order online via kiosk there. &nbsp;then wait outside text ready. &nbsp;hopefully works smoother others forgot one drinks ask (hang receipt!!). workers wearing masks.<br><br>the desserts good - got half sugar right. &nbsp; favorite topping barley almond jelly. &nbsp;we also got winter melon teas mini taro balls good somewhat pricy. &nbsp;we\\'ll back next craving hits!placed order uber eats pickup 8. pickup time 8:10, got there, pick time kept increasing. ended waiting hour realizing meet fresh finished order probably 45 minutes never told uber eats app. thus, order completely melted waited hour reason. <br><br>not satisfied service, although typically desserts good. need better uber eats customer service.if like meet fresh, like one. not, well, still meet fresh. unaware, menu full teas, milk teas, awesome shaved ice desserts, sweet taiwanese snacks like black sesame balls warm almond milk. sorry, savory foods here! however, location plaza full great restaurants sunmerry bakery. <br><br>i like staff location. otherwise, really lot location setting apart others. parking pretty terrible usually, i\\'d suggest going underground parking. due busy plaza is, there\\'s usually quite long line meet fresh. ordering take customers ask lot questions... staff quick orders fly out.this review poor unhelpful attitude employees. mom went get drink today. one store busy. asked woman front order pointed screens. wanted simple milk tea grass jelly told employee. employee unhelpful drink right selection, ended ordering wrong drink using screen, since completely fluent english. could understand differences grass jelly drinks grass jelly topping. wait outside never notified drink ready. go inside ask waiting awhile, drink completely wrong.<br><br>my mom extremely upset piss poor attitude employee, especially considering price drink.<br><br>extremely poor service meet fresh considering predominantly asian clientele. make menu accessible all, help 60 year old woman know english equivalent drink ordered many times counter.meet fresh place experience. truly wish closer location near area. i\\'ve traveled good distance enjoy nourishment. <br><br>my go dish shaved ice variety ingredients. gives opportunity wide range ingredients try everything. plus eat someone else, make eat ones like (not likely, tasty). <br><br>the location pretty chill big. enjoyed high ceilings nice decor. reason always end watching commercials ( tvs play over). <br><br>the service always excellent knowledgeable helpful people. always answer long i\\'m sure annoying question. kudos staff great job! <br><br>i can\\'t wait go back even though far live.it\\'s taiwanese style dessert tons different option. situated one busiest strip mall temple city. hard find upper level parking. parking structure basement. enter underground parking rosemead blvd. <br><br>the dessert ok. bad, great. reason 3 stars simply price. dessert $7. getting ice, sugar, jelly, beans etc. bit overpriced sense. cost around $5 since none material fancy. <br><br>this place seems popular. always line form. lot spacious seating though. think good place hang friends share desert.simply service. hv ordering machine drinks, tried order counter. one line, hv four staffs there, simply ignore completely two minutes order dumb machine again. time also saw customer know put tray n returned counter n politely nodded staff n left, staff ridiculously kept yelling excuse repeatedly n loudly, attempting call customer back clean tray. can\\'t believe rude are. love meet fresh n store walking distance house, never go particular one again.due covid-19. store want people stay outside walk order. ok wait outside umbrella sun <br>cover heat wave period. hopefully seller make well prepare future.i came last night dessert korean bbq. young man took order asked wanted menu. responded \"hot almond soup,\" knowing multiple almond soups. kid me, kept getting distracted first time here. instead politely informing multiple almond soups, annoyingly asked kind almond soup wanted cup bowl. maybe day him, knows? bother me, went back look menu came back final order, signature hot almond soup. <br><br>we ordered three items below, took 15-18 minutes desserts prepared (there multiple orders us). <br><br>- red bean soup mini taro ball sesame rice ball (hot)--i sure is, soup missing something. tasted bit bitter side. think needed slightly sweeter balanced taste. <br><br>- purple rice soup sweet potato taro ball (hot)--this actually quite good. sweetness perfect.<br><br>- signature hot almond soup--this soup consists kidney beans, boba, mini taro balls, almond flakes almond \"soup.\" fillings good. boba soft, like it. beans overcooked almond flakes added nice crunch soup. fan taro balls can\\'t seem taste flavor, enjoy it, taro balls add chewy texture. <br><br>out three desserts tried, think purple rice soup best. right amount sweetness textures ranged soft chewy. signature almond soup also delightful. lighter version compared purple rice soup offers textures range soft, chewy crunchy. <br><br>i like fact meet fresh offers hot desserts, definitely provides feeling comfort cold winter days. recommend place definitely coming back try dessert drinks.good desserts, getting hotter now. &nbsp;your business provide afternoon shaded waiting area many suffering customers.drinks taste like water. except youre paying four bucks water.<br><br>waste time ordering monthly deals. promo: taro egg waffle + hot almond drink $7. spent min trying kiosk. told cashier way get said deal app order. ok that\\'s fine. excited order food, download app, click deal, redirects site?? that! faulty site clickable??? interest time, ordered items individually cashier. ordering frustrating, wait time half hr 3 egg waffles 3 drinks. egg waffles good, milk teas terrible. would call milk tea. little milk little tea little syrup whole lot water ice.<br>get together meet fresh. spend little site seamless user friendly. spend little someone manage staff. advertise deal customers access ordering it. pretty standard stuff...sad see local business turn like thisit took roughly 30 mins (saturday evening, busiest time) get dessert worth it. love ordering system use touch-screen kiosk order food. makes thing easier also safe covid times. favorite signature grass jelly comes grass jelly, taro balls mochi. added sesame balls turned favorite.i also less ice perfect amount. would sure add sesame balls future. lactose intolerant low fodmap diet, dessert place perfect since desserts made rice taro contain little dairy products.sometimes great deals desserts drinks, nice stop every awhile sweet treat! located inside plaza teapot las tunas rosemead blvd, variety desserts jelly noodles, taro balls, boba, etc. mango green tea say right level sweetness boba really soft easy eat. i\\'ve attached picture current menu!summary: &nbsp;how place get 3? &nbsp;god la people damn good. anyone complaining place good better come sf bay area find anything like here! &nbsp;and yes, former la native former sgv resident speaking truth experience. &nbsp;enjoy twice one day!<br><br>background<br>in sept 2018, made long drive (seems longer older get har har) la pay respects friend elementary hs tragically suddenly passed away. keep things light balanced, booked air bnb near old culinary haunt, sgv. &nbsp;i told we\\'re gonna eat really well trip. <br><br>oh money blew food! :)<br><br>so apparently place gotten rave reviews unbeknownst me, wife yelper knew place me. &nbsp;she heard friends insisted go dessert. huuuuuuge fan dou hua (or romanized hwa?) tofu pudding, could say no? 1.9 miles air bnb easy choice.<br><br>desserts<br>so one thing i\\'ve noticed living sf bay area, authenticity asian food 1 2 steps anything that\\'s los angeles. know lot bay area yelp friends going roast person, plain honest truth. go sf korean food, go koreatown la. &nbsp;not mention, there\\'s nothing like valley blvd sgv here. &nbsp;san jose cupertino contenders, alas contenders. &nbsp;<br><br>so anyways, back meet fresh: dessert selection hook stood awe selection. &nbsp;i asked wife wanted said \"we move la\" lol. end ordered standard tofu pudding peanuts. dou jiang (hot soy milk), like keep simple. i\\'m purist like tofu pudding, ice, \"juice\" like call it. <br><br>it excellent. &nbsp;i mean really, really excellent. perhaps we\\'re starved goodness anything average would excellent us. &nbsp;but wife native expert said pretty close grew taiwan.<br><br>parking<br>parking tight little plaza. &nbsp;we found spot back complex need fight space, forewarned.<br><br>return visit?<br>like said, went one temple city later hit one irvine drove stay friends live there. &nbsp;yes, good!i usually many complaints, everything ordering service subpar. siblings way summer rolls also decided get drinks meet fresh. <br>i called number 3 times got response, understandable considering online orders must coming covid. ordered using online system. one thing is, informed long take pay/place order. got email saying would take 25 mins, way expected, way cancel order online. siblings went inside store see could do. <br>the first employee talked quite rude us gestured orders behind him. asked time estimate accurate said \"optimistic\" could take 30 minutes. told people (there 5-8 us waiting orders) wait outside rather obnoxious tone. siblings debating do, asked us go outside (it minute).<br><br>i going take this, asked could cancel order, time. another employee stepped said order next. said order would take 5-7 minutes. however, wanted cancel, alright well. siblings definitely confused point, told would cancel order. <br><br>in general, customer service definitely needs improve, well online ordering system.i completely understand owners business want close earlier posted regular business hour covid-19 era. however, employees encountered recent visit rude toward end work day. &nbsp;they made us feel like bothering job. want jobs i\\'m sure many others would love them. &nbsp;worst all, 4 items ordered multiple ingredients item. offer give us extra leftover ingredients have. &nbsp;we kindly declined requested full refund. &nbsp;we keep receipts. lack professionalism operate business feel watch like hawk. <br><br>my recommendation: go 6pm likely half ingredients properly make dessert want. maybe close 6pm on.i\\'ve missing taiwanese dessert entire life. happened stumble across meet fresh wandering around shopping area street airbnb. originally planning visiting another tapioca spot, seeing line meet fresh see hype about. line mainly due fact one cashier system caused orders backed up. okay, nowhere anyways mind wait. <br><br>i\\'m sure ordered menu, grass jelly shaved ice base, topped grass jelly, sweet potato mochi balls, taro mochi balls, mung bean. feeling bit crazy decided add tapioca egg pudding dish. dish comes tiny creamer add another layer depth. total $9.53, worth it. nice treat end night long day traveling. <br><br>the next night decided stop try soy milk black tea drink. wonder tapioca places offer soy milk option! perfect milk tea imo. soy milk added right amount sweetness without sweet.even covid, customer service never strong suit, used rush rude it. need better signs guidance ordering process (especially elders good electronics ordering tablet). can\\'t leave ordering corner without passing line people. also, eating desserts gonna get messy sticky. can\\'t even get napkins. enforcing social distancing people gather door queuing line. block sections. even mobile app issues. even use app wait line. even announce order ready. think we\\'ll going back.another meet fresh? alright, let\\'s give try again. <br><br>nope. still impressed. <br><br>came dessert family. parking easy plaza, underground parking available though. long line one register actually skip line going straight counter right self order computer. <br><br>we got hot grass jelly basic comforting. <br>we also icy grass jelly shaved ice grass jelly taro balls. ok, get again. <br>also tried wintermelon drink taro balls. weird, little taro balls definitely pose choking hazard careful.<br><br>the menu huge reason, everything seems similar. i\\'m sure. overwhelming pick order seems i\\'m

taiwan, meet fresh known hot herbal grass jelly (what friends call \"old people dessert\"). first meet fresh australia fell love it, hoping it\\'d come us soon. two years later here!<br><br>i always get hot herbal grass jelly unlike joints (looking blackball, even get started), grass jelly soup actually tasty, thick, legit. one way figure legit jelly supposed solidify gets cooler temperature. go anywhere else can\\'t compare. lems really likes red bean soup, i\\'ve never tried cos i\\'m fan general. still really want try douhua, can\\'t help grass jelly.<br><br>there\\'s always line here, know want need ask cashier questions, try ordering self-serve kiosk stand.the new happening plaza, happening taiwanese dessert shop. similar blackball terms style food. ordered taro tofu pudding added boba melon jelly. discovered gave taro&amp;sweet potato balls instead taro. disappointed coming fairly bad day, help.<br><br>besides mishap, tofu pudding decent. softer side (i ordered hot). wish bit quite bit liquid. <br><br> next time took sister get dessert also gave wrong item, put peanuts instead taro! sister decided check right got car, good thing caught mistake time. think come back anytime soon, maybe months employees seasoned. sister commented inefficiency that\\'s much concern me.meh. place pretty mediocre me. flavor-wise, definitely prefer blackball, seating atmosphere-wise, meet fresh tops blackball. <br>personally, feel like blackball\\'s desserts flavor it. seating, place huge. there\\'s many tables situate yourself. atmosphere nicer. employees nicer. non-chinese speaking friends there, place you. i\\'ve many asian dessert places basically require either speak language suffer getting wrong item. place, hand, fluent english speakers. <br><br>herbal jelly #6: meh. flavor one-dimension. herbal jelly also boba, crystal jelly, jelly noodles, taro balls. felt like none toppings kind flavor own. make matters worse, herbal jelly pretty bland too. eating bleh. <br><br>after trying blackball meet fresh, definitely see going back blackball instead, unless i\\'m already plaza. maybe i\\'m judging bit harshly since opened, see driving way this.me someone else ordered one drink, ordered 10 minutes earlier. person received drink 5 minutes ahead me. exception smart asian stereotype. sub 60 iq.taiwanese dessert is....interesting. used dessert sweet, desserts necessarily sweet element it, used think people used want dessert....you know, counter savory dishes had. however, meet fresh, rather taiwanese dessert, sweet, probably meant taste way, yes, bland fresh chilled desserts. <br><br>majority desserts consist shaved ice, pudding, grass jelly, mochi, starchy glutinous products eventually resemble cold soupy dessert. clue friend ordered wait long lines, bowl consisted brown colored shaved ice, grass jelly, noodle jelly, mochi. like said earlier, pretty bland, flavor, taste bad, even condensed milk packets add make taste better suppose, really help whole lot. think end, something refreshing eat, definitely never something find ever craving.<br><br>also, lines long, hype mostly guess since whole lot competition taiwanese dessert places 626 like except maybe blackball.2 stars atmosphere, nice. however, waited hour (see photo) 1 shaved signature. asked 3 times 3 times said coming... disappointed service here. locations seem share bad service. definitely come back again.saturday - line pretty crazy, finally died 11pm.<br>got signature herbal jelly taro mochi, mango pudding mochi.<br><br>the mango pudding mochi good <br>however feels like everything eating texture.<br>it gets boring while<br><br>would come back try tofu pudding<br>but otherwise, would suggest broader menu accommodate optionsbeen back try something different. time got mochi shaved ice dessert. tofu pudding last time time items. seem busy good food fresh bad constantly underestimate amount make ingredients preparation. estimate public vacation mode. people eat back school ect. really enjoy cold deserts cold, sure seems taste better. complaint always things, mochi dish tender cooked, overly sweetened. tasty light. must come back try items. one star constant outrage items.i think pricey bowl iced meet fresh signature contains 4/5 ice 1/5 thin layer herb jelly (aka grass jelly) well 15 pieces taro balls. <br> 1) shaved ice tasty enough herb jelly\\'s sauce, ice much (4/5 bowl\\'s content)<br> 2) grass jelly actually better grass jelly many places, 1 thin layer really satisfy me.<br> 3) 15 pieces taro balls bowl really taste like taro me. size ball actually quite small (about size man\\' short finger nail). perhaps small feel taro inside.<br><br>i also got taro ball tofu pudding along iced meet fresh signature. <br> 1) taro balls bowl better taro filling. <br> 2) tofu quite good. smooth tastes pretty strong soy beans. totally thumb tofu.<br> 3) bowl filled 3/4 sugar water + 1/4 taro balls 1 thin layer tofu (but bit thicker layer grass jelly bowl). <br><br>i used think meet fresh famous taro balls taro balls good tried 2 different meet fresh locations. <br><br>i may come back tasty grass jelly flavored shaved ice future tofu taro balls.easy order process. &nbsp;we placed orders ahead time yelp. &nbsp;they texted us back tell us order would ready. &nbsp;i picked counter. &nbsp;out door. &nbsp;the dessert is, course, delicious.

bigger container j could pour everything done first place instead wasting two medium containers....the girl front said even know why...no wonder reviews suck. bad desserts half decent.<br><br>i frustrated trying open container went back insisted giving bigger container since leaked outside container inside bag, supervisor/manager made new one bigger container. put three stars instead two.i eaten many times think i\\'ve gone entire menu. favorites still tofu fresh grass jelly!if could give negative star, would. placed order two hot red bean soups, #4 #6. got home one hour drive,

responsibility check topping. got two hot red bean soup i\\'d assume topping sank bottom. called store went straight voice recording could even leave message. kind business this?if feeling sweet somewhat healthy would place try. tons options &nbsp;wait long staff super welcoming friendly. they\\'re open pretty late desert place definitely come give try.great decor super busy. meet fresh located popular plaza prepare little wait. turnover fairly quick got table nice cozy little nook. portions felt little bigger one mall. prefer hot desserts honest. whenever get iced one, ice already melting making watery slush. unless get slush ice, would expect icy desserts spectacular. asked to-go menu study offerings menu intimidating line moving fast.finally got try place! hurry knock dessert place list, i\\'d probably recommend going hype dies bit more. went rainy monday night still wait 20 minutes order dessert, another 10 come out.<br><br>in terms interior, new shop new plaza, obviously everything clean, well lit designed, new. customer/server interaction minimal-- line order, buzzer goes go get dessert, finish slide tray counter people wash everything. <br><br>i\\'ve heard lot good things meet fresh, can\\'t help say bit disappointed, least visit. tried signature iced herbal jelly dessert yam taro balls. herbal jelly really good! soft without goop. night day compared canned stuff i\\'ve eaten kid. there\\'s decent amount shaved ice brown sugar beneath herbal jelly, mixed together perfect, refreshing dessert that\\'s sweet super heavy. <br><br>the biggest letdown taro yam balls, though. perfectly chewy, that\\'s compliment give it. lacked distinct taro yam flavors respectively, tasted bit starchy. honest pretty much tasted same, different colors. <br><br>overall, place could 3 4 star dessert shop, depending much like grass jelly. prepared wait!not favorite place, good super close house. sometimes long line order, actually prepare desserts pretty quickly. time organized efficient, although experienced hiccups.love place!! &nbsp;pros: taste great. &nbsp;not sweet. <br>cons: pricy, line crazy long table sit pack.the taro sweet potato balls chewy tender, tell they\\'re freshly made. wait long dessert even though crowded worth it! like much better blackball.my friends tried place since newly opened looked really good. tried hot taro ball tofu pudding cold herbal jelly #2. tofu pudding good except felt like enough taro balls definitely worth $6.30. messed herbal jelly #2 sweet potato. instead gave us herbal jelly #1 mung bean told it, lady added sweet potatoes bowl. guess can\\'t complain since got free topping lol. good nothing wow. overall, &nbsp;i prefer blackball since topping choices like matcha balls matcha jelly better pricing too.if give

finally get front line!<br><br>and...while standing waiting get attention order server, turns cheerfully (and cluelessly) informs me...<br><br>\"it 30 minutes get anything!\"<br><br>anything? like even tea shaved ice?<br><br>\"yes. 30 minutes...or maybe little less. &nbsp;but least 20 minutes. think fair give go orders priority dining in. &nbsp;that fair.\"<br><br>wow.<br><br>well, let\\'s start obvious, shall we?<br><br>1) knew poor suckers, customers, (including me) got winding cumbersome line thirty minutes ago order tea dessert, would least another 30 minutes could produce even cup tea ordering, announce crowd line could make choice lost nearly thirty minutes getting front line, learning another half hour wait--for tea? &nbsp;this inconsiderate stupid. &nbsp;<br><br>the several people left line frustration lot smarter i.<br><br>2) fair prioritize people dropping pick tea leave dining in, time wait. &nbsp;duh. &nbsp;they dining in. &nbsp;they hanging out, talking friends, playing phones, yelping, you. &nbsp;sure, dine-in customers also wait inordinate amount time get amounts pre-made teas desserts. &nbsp;but idea priorities illogical. &nbsp;if i\\'m sitting in, enjoying time friends, working laptop, tea house (or coffee shop), likely, i\\'m going around hour so. &nbsp;but i\\'m pick tea go, likely time frame (as people) quite lot shorter. would expect 15-20 minutes, even slightly longer average line. &nbsp;perhaps \"meet fresh\" needs work mind again. &nbsp;somehow think right.<br><br>3) going customers waiting upwards 1 hour tea desserts? putting difficult elaborate dishes. &nbsp;this poor planning. &nbsp;my goodness, deep. &nbsp;more half menu tea, half dishes pre-made, (i.e., made order), \"tofu pudding.\" sure, made daily. &nbsp;but made hourly? minute-ly? seconds-ly?<br><br>bottom line: &nbsp;i feel respected customer. &nbsp;when decided would stay wait hopelessly another 30 minutes cup tea (after waiting line amount time already, without knowing looking forward terms time), server like, \"okay, \\'bye!\" like serious regret shop wasted time (which us precious), fear maybe lost future customers. &nbsp;like no, \"here\\'s coupon next time\" \"here\\'s \\'front line\\' pass next time neighborhood.\" &nbsp;(these possible examples make us). just, \"bye.\"<br><br>yeah. &nbsp;\"bye, felicia.\"<br><br>2 stars 1 least shop cute, rude it.came first time rounds bowling nearby. friend wanted try came dessert. <br><br>located right next tofu hut, sits opposite side long strip mall known places like hot &amp; juicy, djk, etc.

additional almond jelly/pudding (free topping yelp check in). signature includes taro sweet potato mochi balls w/ \"herbal jelly\" \"herbal jelly flavored ice\". fortunately, \"herbal jelly\" known \"grass jelly\" little milder flavor sweetness prefer. typically like mildly sweeter grass jelly lot evaporated milk. provide 1 little cup half &amp; half/creamer, like get cafe coffee. luckily people like grass jelly like actual \"herbal jelly\" friend thought would be, meaning 龜苓膏 (gui ling gao) made bottom shell golden coin turtle, quite bitter. <br><br>the taro sweet potato balls also mild

signature delicious! taro balls great chewy texture, brown sugar shaved ice complemented well herbal jelly coconut milk. sweet (like asian desserts) refreshing hot summer day. &nbsp;<br><br>i gave place 4 stars mind-blowingly delicious - work ratios. think bit coconut milk (i got mini plastic cup shown image) add greater coconut flavor, little bit shaved ice make dessert little sweeter colder, would say dessert complete.taiwanese desserts always amazing!<br>the menu really long, several options:<br>hot/cold, herbal jelly, sweet pudding/douhua, taro, rice balls, drinks forth.<br>in winter time always ordered red bean soup several topoing time herbal jelly shaved ice, red beans, bubbles, rice balls peanuts. yummy refreshing! bowl big ended full satisfied!<br>the bad think change menu

100% perfect needed ask several options ordering waisting cashiers 3/4min...i\\'ve couple times normally go herbal/grass jelly taro. iced signature herbal jelly really refreshing everytime light. usually add half &amp; half preference.<br><br>if like asian desserts mood taiwan based desserts, worth checking area.(edit: they\\'re ubereats that\\'s one way enjoy dessert without experiencing bad service.)<br><br>tasty dessert truly horrid service. &nbsp;just imagine buying dessert dmv tsa pretty good idea like.<br><br>the food:<br><br>i first taro balls taiwan love chewy texture goes extremely well shaved ice. &nbsp;the menu unnecessarily annoyingly complicated instead choosing existing combo 100 look same, would recommend hack starting base pay thing add on. &nbsp;you\\'ll end paying anyway. &nbsp;i particularly recommend shaved ice amazing, possibly best ever had. <br><br>the service:<br><br>guy manning door acts like he\\'s bouncer super exclusive club. &nbsp;or actually take back, bouncers much nicer - really like nyc tsa. &nbsp;<br><br>he first yelled everyone queuing inside barrier rope thing outside store, physically impossible poorly set one could fit inside unless 12. &nbsp;<br><br>then yelled people opening door store without permission. &nbsp;because fire hazard.<br><br>then held menu dark one could see. &nbsp;when reached see it, yelled touch! &nbsp;because \"they issues past\". &nbsp;really? &nbsp;you\\'ve issues people waiting line dessert place touching piece laminated menu? &nbsp;pardon lack imagination here.<br><br>when finally made inside door, realized 1) pretty empty inside like fake exclusive club 2) line actually unnecessarily long one time look complicated menu getting cashier. &nbsp;so everyone spends 10 minutes per person ordering. &nbsp;i must naive almost like everything set maximize profits. &nbsp;<br><br>i would still go back like taro balls much. &nbsp;but would probably pick different time day saturday night door guy gets bouncer role play.i\\'ve locations meetfresh china excited try this!<br><br>we got two different ices addins one brown sugar bubble tea. order counter give buzzer order. takes extremely long get order given wrong order...twice. <br><br>besides this, shaved ice different addins good taste like ones china. tapioca balls taro balls perfectly \"qq\" nice chewy!<br><br>the brown sugar bubble tea bad though. definitely cook bubbles brown sugar like reknown brands(tiger sugar, yifang) little brown sugar literally tasted like lightly sweetened milk bubbles. stay away brown sugar boba!

entire bowl yourself. friends basically ate meal replacement lunch full afterwards real food. first glance, dessert look appetizing trust me, actually pretty good! normally like taro taro balls serve extremely chewy remind tapioca ten times better. shaved ice kind looks like brown sugar underneath toppings might want mix everything together spoon first dig in. also, forget drizzle cream top!<br><br>minus one star table seating arrangement. location extremely cramped go peak hours, almost impossible grab seat table. definitely someone grab table ordering something would want order go. would definitely go i\\'m ever mood something refreshing chewy feeling bubble tea. would probably skip though there\\'s long line.i understand hype place. dessert average meh, cheap. chinatown couple blocks probably offer thing better cheaper. <br><br>i really hate layout store. none makes sense. long line people absolutely move around store. try moving lunch tray big bowls full hot soup without spilling anyone. <br><br>there huge table middle makes harder people sitting next tables get leave. everybody trapped. <br><br>the line garbage throw trash also makes sense. expect go table, crowd, line, get trash can. can\\'t explain dumb layout place see improperly managed is. whoever designed place needs rethink this. <br><br>dessert meh. go back.i feel bad even though place\\'s desserts pretty good, poor ratings due organization logicstics business. start, want say 5 star rating based solely food/desserts. <br>we\\'ll talk stuff food :) <br><br>i\\'ve already multiple times week tried couple things. <br><br>the signature: really good refreshing, sweet always plus. grass jelly, shaved flavored grass jelly ice, taro sweet potato mochi. can\\'t go wrong add taro chunks, oh em gee! bombs. <br><br>tofu pudding taro chunks: really good too. tofu made taiwan soy beans supposedly. fresh syrup bathed in, sweet. looks it, sweet like traditional kinds get streets. taro chunks soooo good. sometimes middle cooked fully through, still sooo good. place gives much taro chunks. worth price. <br><br>bubble tea legit. strong tea taste boba soft chewy. overall, everything good worth price. think 8.2$ expensive, get large quantity. even share 2 people. get bowl alone, actually end getting stuffed, little stuffed. place legit taiwan. def taste authenticity. <br><br>the thing sucks line. come enough, learn peak hours fine avoid crazy lines. friday staurday nights, expect long line bouncer dude seats. otherwise, dessert fantastic.literally one time favorite dessert spots. say love texture taro balls mix shaved ice &nbsp;winner! coming past year still love every time. con run big taro balls early due popularity. <br><br>should definitely try place around st mark\\'s!

try more!the staff friendly helpful. &nbsp;it quiet place hang out. try shaved ice next time i\\'m neighborhood.this second time coming location. last time pleasant experience wait ice shavings.<br><br>however, time different experience compared last time. originally wanted get mango ice shavings ran out. second option would strawberry ice shavings. <br><br>we paid order 14:27. still waiting ice shavings write review. currently 3:04pm. wonder staff forgot order? husband went asked order. received dissatisfaction respond one female worker. response \"it takes time shave ice
